{"asin": "0373874987", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Can't go home again. Can't go home again.The words repeated in the slap of the car's worn tires against the highway as Kate Wallace headed west out of Burnet and into the heart of the Texas Hill Country.But here she was, doing exactly that. Going home. And not a bit happy about it.She took the curve on Highway 29 too fast. As the car leaned into the turn, Kate put her hand on the elderly buff cocker spaniel sleeping next to her to make sure the dog didn't fall off the seat.Why was she in such a hurry? It wasn't as if the town of Silver Lake would disappear if she dawdled.Slowing, she headed north on County Road 144A. Within a few minutes, she was speeding through rolling hills, past the thick groves of trees and the shimmering green grass that covered central Texas in the spring. Here and there, she spotted patches of bluebonnets, promises of the beauty to come.Twenty minutes later, she pulled off the highway at the top of the hill that overlooked Silver Lake and kept the engine running.Scratching her dog Coco's ears, Kate breathed in the spicy scent of cedars as she studied the town spread out below her.\"Kate Wallace,\" she whispered. \"You really are home again.\" An emotion filled her, an odd mixture of hope and resignation, shame and excitement which made her want to grin and to cry and to flee from here as fast as her old car could take her.At twenty-one, she'd left Silver Lake with a brand-new degree in journalism and her entire future ahead. Without a backward glance, she'd shaken the dust of small-town Texas off her feet and headed to the big city.Twelve years later, here she was, back in Silver Lake without her youth and confidence and missing a few other things, as well.She closed her eyes, trying to replace the view of the small hill-country town with the towering buildings of New York and Houston and the pulsing rhythms of Miami, the cities she'd loved so much. When she opened her eyes the city limits sign&#151;Silver Lake, Population 7,881&#151;stared back at her and the leaves of post oaks rustled in the breeze.No doubt about it. She was in Mesa County, Texas.She glanced at her watch. Noon on Saturday. She could sneak into town. With everyone shopping in Austin or Granite Falls, the square would be deserted.Not that anyone would recognize her now. She was thirty-three and looked every day of it. Her silver-blond hair had darkened over the years and she'd chopped off her long curls six months ago.Coming home wasn't her choice, but it was the only remaining option.After she'd testified against her boss&#151;a well-known congressman she'd served as press secretary&#151;few choices remained. When her sister Abby's e-mail had arrived three weeks earlier asking Kate to come home and care for her after shoulder surgery, she'd grabbed the opportunity to escape.She shifted out of Park and stepped on the gas. Within minutes, she passed a new Dollar Merchandise store next to a new H-E-B grocery store.When a chatting group of people stepped off the curb, Kate returned to reality, slammed on the brakes and stopped inches short of them.Thank you, Lord,she whispered, a little surprised at how good that short prayer felt. She couldn't remember the last time she'd said one.On the sidewalk stood Sara Arroyo, her former best friend. She'd changed, but no one else in town had hair that dark and full and beautiful. Kate should jump from the car and apologize for dropping out of sight. She should tell Sara she was home and they had to get together. But she didn't. Today she wanted to slink back into town. Besides, Sara held the hands of two children. Kate didn't want to interrupt whatever they were doing, an explanation even she recognized as a terrible excuse.At Lloyd's Auto Repair and Battery Services, she turned left onto Goliad Street. She followed the curve for another block as she drove between rows of towering live oak trees dripping in Spanish moss until she stopped in front of the three-story Victorian house that used to be home.The house appeared exactly as it had when she took off, the walls still pale yellow with the gingerbread trim painted green, pink and lavender. In the noonday sun, the house, a national historic home, shone like the multicolored jewel she was.\"That's where I grew up, Coco.\" The fragile old dog smiled up at her.Kate hit the trunk latch and got out of the car. After grabbing a couple of worn Louis Vuitton suitcases from the back, she toted them around the passenger side of the car and opened the door. She snapped on Coco's leash and lifted the dog out of the car and onto the grass.Matching Coco's pace, she ambled to the porch steps where the little dog tried to climb the first step but couldn't lift her arthritic rear leg. The cocker slid down to the stones of the sidewalk, her soft brown eyes focused on Kate, and gave her a \"Woof.\"\"I know, Coco. Old age must be tough.\" Kate dumped the luggage and leaned down to pick Coco up and place her gently on the porch.\"Why do you carry that dog around?\"Surprised to hear the voice, Kate straightened and saw a girl, probably eight or nine years old, standing inside the front door. She wore pink slacks and a black-and-pink-striped T-shirt. With her hand, the child combed out tangles in her straight brown hair. Who else could she be but her niece? She had Abby's small bones and beautiful features.\"Hello, Brooke. I'm your aunt Kate.\"Brooke stared at her.\"This is my dog, Coco.\"Coco woofed, not loudly, just as a greeting.\"She's old and has arthritis so she can't get up and down very well.\"\"That's a really ugly car,\" she said, then headed upstairs. When she reached the landing, she said, \"My mother's at work.\"Kate dropped her suitcases on the shiny parquet floor inside. \"On Saturday?\"Brooke disappeared without another word.It wasn't as if Kate were a guest or helpless. She'd grown up here and could find a room for herself. \"Stay, Coco,\" she said as if the little dog would move. She climbed upstairs and looked down the long hall. Three bedrooms and a bath on each side before a right turn into the other wing.As she contemplated the staircase and the difficulty of carrying Coco up and down, she remembered a bedroom off the kitchen where their housekeepers had stayed years ago. With its private bathroom and proximity to the back door, it would fit her and Coco perfectly.She found the linen closet and picked out everything she needed. From below came Coco's soft whimpers. \"It's okay,\" she shouted as she climbed down the steps. Words the elderly and nearly deaf dog couldn't hear but it comforted her to say them. That short phrase was filled with optimism, the hope that everything would be fine, that her sister would welcome her and that Coco would live forever.When she shoved the door to the small first-floor apartment open, she found a room empty of furniture but with a heavy covering of dust and a few cobwebs. She reached out to touch the wall and felt layers of dust on her fingers. Not up to Abby's usual immaculate standards. That shoulder must really be bothering her to allow dust and cobwebs to accumulate anywhere in her house.Our house, Kate corrected herself, as her parents had left the house to both daughters.She went back to the kitchen, dropped the linens on the counter and tried to reorient herself. What she needed was a broom, dustpan, some rags and maybe a chair or two. Where would they be?For two hours, while Coco slept on a spot of sunshine in the kitchen, Kate swept and mopped, wiped down everything in the small apartment. That completed, she opened the bathroom door and groaned at the state of the tiny place but plowed right in.Kate had never been much of a housekeeper. At times she wished she'd inherited a smidgen of her mother's compulsive need to clean in her own genetic makeup, never more strongly than now.\"Are you going to stay in here?\" Brooke called from the hall outside the bedroom.\"Yes.\" Kate stood and stretched.The child glanced around the small area and shook her head.With one last scrub of the bathroom sink, Kate asked, \"Why's your mom at work?\"\"Trying to get caught up on stuff.\"Exactly like Abby. \"Why aren't you out with your friends on a pretty day like today?\"Brooke twisted her hair with a finger. \"I don't feel well,\" she mumbled. \"And I like to read. In my room.\"Kate didn't pry further. \"Is there a bed anywhere I can use?\" she said.Brooke said nothing. Like her mother, Brooke gave less information than anyone needed, but Kate refused to play that game. Arms crossed, she waited.\"There's a shed in the backyard,\" the child finally said.Oh, yes, the old shed. Her father had used it for his woodworking shop, his tools mixed companionably with her mother's gardening equipment.\"Thanks.\" But Brooke was gone.An odd child, but with Abby for a mother, who wouldn't be? Kate had been surprised that a man as nice as Charles Granger had married Abby, had actually seemed eager to, but he had and this lonely child was the outcome. Where was he now?Thirty minutes later, with the rooms tidy, Kate headed out back to the shed. Once in the backyard, she paused to remember the glory of her mother's flower beds, imagining the heaps of orange and yellow roses and beds of tulips and daffodils of brightly colored blooms now replaced by thick grass. She wished she'd come back years earlier to see Mom attacking the weeds and fooling with her flowers while Dad built stuff in his workshop. An aching sense of loss rolled over her.In honor of her mother, maybe she'd plant something while she was here. What else did she have to do except take care ofAbby after the surgery? Gardening would allow her time away from Abby before they drove each other crazy.But she wasn't going to be here long enough.She'd be leaving in a month, getting on with her life, whatever that meant. She headed to the shed again and shoved the door open to see a jumble of furniture that seemed to have woven itself into an enormous granny knot.", "title": "Deep in the Heart (Love Inspired #462)", "price": 3.79, "salesRank": {"Books": 2587126}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B6nB3qrwL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373813287", "0373812248", "0373828039", "0803495366", "0803497571", "0764210424", "0892968958", "0892969032"]}}

{"asin": "0373875002", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Excuse me, where is the patient I'm operating on this morning?\" Dr. Nora Blake stood impatiently at the nurses' station in the Pediat-ric Intensive Care Unit. Two nurses in brightly colored uniforms were laughing about something until they heard her voice. Then they immediately fell silent, their smiles vanishing.Nora knew she wasn't a favorite with the staff. She didn't possess the people skills many of her colleagues displayed. Her insistence on attention to detail and her intolerance of mediocre work had earned her the reputation of being difficult.It wasn't that she didn't care what her coworkers thought of her&#151;she did. It hurt to see how quickly their expressions changed from cheerful to guarded, but making sure her patients received the highest quality care was far more important than being popular.Arching one eyebrow, the slender nurse with short blond hair asked, \"Do you mean Cara Dempsey?\"Nora raised her chin. Her skill was saving children with heart defects, not winning popularity contests. Professionalism was the key to getting things done right in the hospital, not sociability.\"I'm looking for the patient who came in from Blackwater General yesterday with transposition of the great arteries. Do you have the chart?\" The words came out sounding sharper than she intended.The ward nurse held out a black three-ring binder. \"The patient is in room five. Dr. Kent just finished talking to the parents.\"\"Thank you.\" Nora nodded, relieved to hear that her partner had arrived first. Peter Kent would have explained the coming procedure to the family. It saved Nora the time and headache of trying to make laypeople understand the complex nature of the upcoming operation.If she found any fault with Peter, who was ten years her senior and had been her partner for the past two years, it was that he was too upbeat in dealing with the families. As far as she was concerned, he often sugarcoated the truth and offered false hope. She would need to impress on the Dempsey family the risks involved, especially for an infant. Not every patient survived open-heart surgery.Thumbing through the chart, she paid special attention to the laboratory values and medications being given to the two-day-old infant. Satisfied that everything had been done correctly, she closed the binder and moved to the computer in the corner of the desk area reserved for use by physicians. She pulled up the echo-cardiogram images of her patient.She had already studied the scans extensively in her office late last night, but she wanted to make sure that she hadn't missed anything, so she watched the movie of the child's beating heart one more time. As always, a profound sense of wonder and awe engulfed her. The human heart was a beautiful thing.She quickly focused on gathering the information she would need to repair the child's flawed heart. Operating on a newborn baby was always hard for her. It brought back too many painful memories. She preferred her patients to be at least six months old, but this child wouldn't live a week without surgery. It had to be done now.The quality of the echocardiogram and tests were excellent, but Nora wouldn't know what she was actually dealing with until she looked inside the patient's chest. If there was one thing that she had learned during her years of training, it was that every heart was unique.Leaving the desk, Nora walked to room five. Outside, she paused a moment to brace herself. Drawing a deep breath, she pasted a smile on her face, knocked once and then entered.Inside, she saw a young couple sitting on the small couch at the back of the room with their arms around each other for support. They both had red-rimmed eyes, either from crying or from lack of sleep or both. They looked shell-shocked and barely out of their teens&#151;far too young to be facing what lay ahead.They both rose to their feet, and their hopeful eyes begged her for help she wasn't sure she could give. For a split second she envied them each having someone to hold on to during the coming hours. She had been in their shoes once with no one to comfort her. The memory of those terrible days haunted her still.On the warming bed, a baby girl with thick dark hair lay unnaturally still. A white tube taped to her mouth connected her to a ventilator. IV pumps and monitors took up most of the space around her and beeped softly. Drugs kept her from moving and fighting the very machines that were keeping her alive. Even with the ventilator breathing for her, the child's lips were dark blue. It wasn't a good sign.Nora nodded at the parents. \"I'm Dr. Blake and I'll be performing your child's surgery this morning.\"The father spoke quickly. \"You can make her well, can't you? Doctor Kent, he said you were the best.\"\"As you know, your daughter was born with the blood vessels leading from the heart in the wrong places. Outcomes are usually good with this procedure, but five percent of the children who have this done don't survive or survive with serious brain damage. You need to be aware of that.\"Cara's mother laid a loving hand on her daughter's small head. \"God will be with you and with Cara. He will save her. God can do anything.\"Nora bit back the comment that rose to her lips. She didn't share this young mother's belief in a benevolent God, but she had learned that revealing her philosophy with families frequently increased their anxiety.Instead, she said, \"I'll meet with you in the surgical waiting room when the operation is over. It will take several hours, but one of the staff will come out to give you updates during that time.\"The door to the room opened and the blond nurse looked in. \"Mr. and Mrs. Dempsey, would you please step out to the desk? I have some forms for you to sign.\"As the couple followed the nurse out into the hall, Nora found herself alone with her patient. Looking down at the baby depending on her for so much, she experienced a pang of overwhelming compassion. Reaching out, she stroked the child's hair with one hand. The tiny curls were soft as silk.\"If God can do anything, then why am I always fixing His mistakes?\" Nora whispered.She touched the small oval locket that hung on a gold chain around her neck. There was no answer to her question today. There never had been.Catching her lower lip between her teeth, she closed her eyes and regained the composure she would need in surgery. Intense focus, not sympathy, would save this child.After leaving the baby's room, Nora headed to the elevators. At the fifth floor, she stepped out and walked quickly toward the operating suites.She passed the pre-op nurses' station without pausing, barely noticing the women in green surgical garbs identical to her own standing in a group behind the tall, black granite counter.Her mind was already intent on the delicate surgery she would be doing in the next few minutes. She rehearsed each move in detail.Step-by-step, she visualized the course of the entire procedure, taking into account the obstacles and challenges the walnut-sized heart of this baby might present. Once the operation was under way, timing would be critical. The child couldn't afford to have her surgeon wondering what to do next.The hallway led her past the family waiting room outside the surgery doors. Nora didn't bother glancing in. The parents would stay upstairs until the OR and PICU staff moved the baby to the surgery. If all went well, Nora would find Mr. and Mrs. Dempsey in about four hours and tell them their baby was still alive.Ifall went well? It was a big if. There were so many things that could go wrong.\"Dr. Blake, may I have a word with you, please?\"Startled by the sound of a deep male voice behind her, Nora spun around. It took her a second to place the tall man with wavy dark brown hair who stepped out of the waiting room. When she did, she scowled.Mr. Robert Dale, persistent reporter for theLiberty and Justicenewspaper jogged toward her.He was a man most women would notice. Dressed in jeans and a blue button-down shirt, he exuded confidence. His long stride and easy grace had her guessing that he was a runner, an activity that she enjoyed as often as her work permitted. His rugged features and deep tan made it clear that he preferred the outdoors over a treadmill. His bright blue eyes were fixed on her now with the intensity of a sprinter sighting the finish line.She didn't intend to become his journalistic prize.\"I'm on my way to surgery, Mr. Dale. I'm afraid I don't have time to answer your questions.\"Not bothering to hide her annoyance, she turned back toward the OR and quickened her pace. The wide, gray metal doors were only a few yards away. He couldn't follow her in there.The man had been practically stalking her in his quest for information about the Ali Tabiz Willis case. The story of a five-year-old war orphan from the Middle East being flown to Texas for life-saving open-heart surgery apparently made a good human interest story. At least, Mr. Dale's paper seemed to think it did.Or maybe they were so interested because the boy's grandfather was a retired U.S. Army general.Either way, Mr. Dale had called her office enough times over the past few days that she had finally instructed her secretary to stop taking his messages. It seemed he couldn't take a hint.A sudden thought struck her&#151;how had he found out that she would be here? She hadn't known until late last night that she would be doing surgery this morning. Annoyance flared into anger at the possibility that her secretary or one of the hospital nurses had informed him of her schedule.Determined to find out who had leaked the information, she spun around to confront him. Her abrupt change in direction caught him off guard and he plowed into her. The impact knocked her backward.His strong hands shot out and grabbed her arms to keep her upright. \"Sorry about that, Doc.\"The feel of his long fingers curled around her bare arms triggered a thrill of awareness that shocked her. She drew a deep breath to steady her nerves. It didn't help. Instead, it flooded her senses with the masculin...", "title": "A Matter of the Heart (Homecoming Heroes, Book 4) (Love Inspired #464)", "price": 3.79, "salesRank": {"Books": 1854398}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Yic8FGjgL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373875045", "0373875088", "037387488X", "0373817525", "0373874928", "0373815700", "0373815832", "0373873492", "0373813740", "0373873379", "0373814097", "0373875061", "0373816286", "0373675534", "0373675615", "0373874782", "0373875274", "0373812868", "037381464X", "0373675461", "0373445245", "0373445369", "0373876149", "0373814380", "0373445296", "0373876327", "0373874227", "0373813503", "0373445202", "0373878532", "0373445288", "0373878125", "0373876262", "037367581X", "0373877838", "0373816561", "0373675143", "0373877811", "037381657X", "0373877706", "0373445083", "0373445172", "0373816855", "0373877641", "037387782X", "0373877005", "0373877765", "0373877587"], "buy_after_viewing": ["037387488X", "0373874782", "0373875061"]}}

{"asin": "0373874510", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "My sister, Mickey, apologizes a lot these days.\"I can't imagine what Tommy and Terry were doing to knock it off the top of your china cabinet.You have no idea how badly I feel, Suze. We'll pay for it, of course&#8230;.\"\"Never mind, I didn't like those Waterford crystal candlesticks much anyway.\"Mickey has been asking for forgiveness, expressing regret and acting contrite for three years. That's when her twins learned to walk. Before that, life was relatively calm. Since the boys mastered locomotion, however, nothing has been the same. Tommy and Terry are adorable with loose black curls, blue-violet eyes with long lashes as dark as midnight, rosy cheeks and wide smiles that reveal faint dimples. We lovingly refer to them as the Terror Twins, Tommy Tomahawk and Terry the Tormentor.Mickey, whose name is short for Michelle, flung herself onto my couch. \"I can't go. It would be cruel and unusual punishment to make you take care of the boys for three months.\"\"Nonsense. They're my flesh and blood. Of course I'll take care of them.\" Saying it, I felt a little like the martyr Stephen stepping up to be stoned. \"Do what you need to do to adopt your baby girl. If it means staying in South America for ten or twelve weeks until the baby is ready to leave the country, then go for it.\"Medical  problems  had  made  it  impossible  for Mickey to have any more children, and she's always dreamed of having a little girl. I love my sister and would do anything for her. I'd give her a kidney. Of course, offering to care for the Terrors for twelve weeks might be more like giving her both my kidneys.\"Have you heard anything on the new job yet?\" Mickey asked.\"I'm interviewing in Chicago on Thursday.\"\"You aren't moving there are you?\"\"No, but I have to interview at the main office.\"\"What if you have to start immediately?You wouldn't be able to take care of the kids while we're gone.\"\"The position doesn't actually open up for four months. Someone is retiring. Besides, if I did have to travel, Mom and Dad could manage an overnight or two with the boys.\" My parents, though only in their early sixties, can't handle the boys full-time. When I think about it, no one can, not even the boys' own parents.\"Mom and Dad would come here to feed the animals anyway.\"\"Speaking of the animals, what have you got now? Other than that crazed hamster, I mean.\"\"He's not crazed. He's sensitive, that's all.\" Whenever Hammie perceives that I'm upset, he gets upset, too&#8212;and begins to run on that wheel of his until I settle down. He's become a great predictor of my emotions. He's also made my home a much calmer place. I have to stay calm&#8212;deep breathing and envisioning a sunny place with vast white beaches and dolphins playing in the surf&#8212;otherwise the sound of that whirring, rattling wheel in his cage would drive me nuts.\"There's a lady in my spinning class who was very interested in what you do. She is looking for a dog for her mother&#8212;something loving and easy to spoil.\"\"Chipper would be perfect. She'd like a black Pekingese. He's small, dignified, affectionate, a real character. He needs lots of brushing though.\"\"That's  fine.  Her  children  have  requested  that Grandma get a dog to groom so she'll be too busy to tell them to cut their hair and dye it back to normal colors. But what's this dog's problem?\"All my pets come with problems. I'm a foster mother for a last-chance pet adoption agency. These are the animals that literally no one wants. When they reach our agency, these are the saddest little creatures on the planet. Health problems, age, bad hair and bad habits bring them to us. I take in these pitiful little creatures, fatten them up, doctor them until they are healthy, teach them manners and make them more desirable in any way I can. Then I attempt to place them in loving homes.\"His foot is missing. Got it caught in a mousetrap. He wandered around lost, dragging it until it got infected. It may bother someone else but it doesn't bother Chipper.\"Mickey winced. \"Poor little thing. Do you have a photo? I'll take it to spinning tomorrow.\"At that moment, the mini-watchdog in question set up a commotion in the kitchen. There were no burglars in the house, just two naughty scamps trying to remove a package of Oreos from the top shelf of a cupboard.Terry stood on my kitchen counter tippy-toed on the Minneapolis telephone book reaching for the cookies while Tommy, belly down on the counter, resolutely held on to Terry's ankles. When Terry fell he'd take Tommy right off the counter with him, but they hadn't factored that into their equation. The twins always assume they will succeed at their schemes and spend little  time  dwelling  on  the  consequences  of  their actions.\"Terry!\" Mickey screeched unhelpfully. Her guilty son turned to look at her and teetered on his perch. Mickey reached out to catch Terry while I dove for Tommy, still clinging tenaciously to his brother's feet. The impact of Terry's fall sent Mickey flying backward into my kitchen table. I heard the tinkle of breaking glass.Mickey and Terry stared down at the other Waterford candlestick holder lying shattered on the kitchen floor.\"Oh, well,\" I said weakly. \"At least now they're a matching set again.\"Discipline is always harder on the adults than the children themselves. As the boys sat in opposite corners of my living room howling at the indignity of having to stay in one place for more than twelve seconds, Mickey and I sat across the room pretending we could hear ourselves talking.\"Are you going to be able to handle a third child, Mickey?\" I tried to be gentle. \"It takes a village to raise just these two.\"\"We'll be fine. The boys will be in school soon. That will help.\"It will help Mickey, but what about the American educational system? Isn't it in enough trouble as it is?\"Tell me more about this job interview,\" Mickey encouraged. \"Are you flying in and out the same day?\"\"No. The interview is early in the morning. I've made a reservation at the Omni. I'll have dinner, relax and get a good night's sleep to be sharp for the meeting.\"\"Overnight?\" Mickey's blue eyes darkened. \"Suze, are you sure?\"\"Positive,\" I said shortly.\"But your problem&#8230;What are you going to do about that? I mean, really, a hotel?\"I willed myself to be calm. \"My 'problem' as you so obliquely refer to it, has kept me from traveling for far too long. I've decided to fight back.\"I'm not going to let it stop me from getting a promotion in my company or from traveling to places I've always wanted to visit. It's war this time, Mickey.\"But how to conduct a war with an enemy that only attacks at night while I'm asleep?\"You know how you are, Suze. What if you sleepwalk? You could walk out of the hotel and get into trouble.\"Sleepwalking. Who would believe the heartache it has caused me?\"The registration desk at the Omni is not on street level. That's why I chose it. Besides, I bought this.\" I held  up  the  padlock  I'd  purchased  this  morning.\"There's no way I'll be able to unlock it if I am asleep. Don't worry. I'll be fine.\"My family's tales about the crazy things I've done while sleepwalking are legendary. If I remained inside the house during my nighttime meanderings, it would be one thing, but I tend to wander. It's not just anyone who has ended up in her neighbor's kitchen making eggs Benedict at 3:00 a.m. or has been awakened by a policeman while in the 7-Eleven buying Tootsie Rolls and trying to pay for them with bus tokens.My own home is wired with alarms so that if I open a door they wake not only me but the dead in three counties. Other places&#8230;well, that's a different matter.\"I'll let the front desk know,\" I assured Mickey. \"If they see me leaving, they can bring me back.\"\"I don't know why you want this job anyway. It involves travel.\" Mickey's lips turned downward at the corners. \"Your family is here. We'll take care of you.\"True, they would take care of me, but they also have a lot of laughs at my expense. There's that running joke my brother, Mike, started when we were in high school that's only grown over the years. \"How can you tell if Suze has been sleepwalking?\" he would ask at the dinner table. \"All the eggs in the carton are already fried!\"\"&#8230;the washing machine is full of freshly washed shoes&#8230;.\"\"&#8230;the dog is wearing an undershirt and a pair of boxers&#8230;.\"Fortunately Mike moved to Germany where he is teaching English and I have a two-year reprieve from his teasing.I'm creative in my sleep. What's so bad about that? Everything. \"I've never dared travel alone and it's time I quit allowing my fear to rule me and to master this thing. I want to take care of myself and I want to travel.\"\"When you're sleepwalking no one realizes it, Suze. You talk and act like you are totally awake. What if you get mixed up with some horrible man or walk onto the freeway?\"\"I'll buy another padlock. I am going, Mickey, and I don't want you to worry about me. I'll be fine.\" I didn't tell her I'd also considered buying a box of tacks to strew across the hotel-room floor, hoping that pain and blood would wake me up before I escaped.\"Okay, if you say so.\" She stood up and kissed me on the cheek. \"Now I think I'll take the boys home and give you a break. You'll have plenty of them soon enough.\"As I closed the door behind my sister and nephews, I leaned against it and sighed. Mickey was worried about my health and welfare, certainly. Didn't she realize that I'd probably be in more danger from the Terrors than wandering alone and asleep on Michigan Avenue?The flight from Minneapolis to Chicago took just over an hour, and I reached my hotel with plenty of time to check in and unpack before dinner. My college roommate, Darla, is in middle management in the insurance company for which we work.

{"asin": "0373876327", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Lost in the Alaskan wilderness.Penelope Lear's great adventure was not supposed to end this way, with her standing on a shadowy path in the middle of nowhere. Mountains surrounded her, cutting her off from the rest of the world. She was completely, utterly alone in a world so huge she didn't know in which direction to turn.What had started with her brilliant idea that she could find the treasure and save the town of Treasure Creek was now looking like a news alert. All because she was positive she'd seen a clue from the treasure map. Just days ago when she'd taken a hiking tour of the area, she really thought she'd seen the rock formation that people were talking about. Her dad would have told her she was less than a week in town and already in over her head.Instead of the confidence she had started out with, she was picturing the headlines that would be splashed across newspapers tomorrow morning. Or whenever they finally realized she was missing.&#34;Penelope Lear, Heiress, Lost in the Alaskan Wilderness.&#34;She didn't want to think of other headlines, worse headlines. But she couldn't stop herself from thinking about what would happen if someone didn't find her. If they didn't find the Jeep and her note that she was hiking out, heading south toward Treasure Creek, what would happen?As for heading south, she hoped she was heading south.She glanced at her watch and then looked west, where the sun would have been setting in an hour, if not for the mountains encircling her. At least shethoughtshe was looking west. She had a compass in her bag, but she didn't know how to use a compass. It had been part of the equipment she'd bought at the general store.The clerk had grinned at her when she'd bought supplies. Either because he was single and enjoyed all the single women trotting through Treasure Creek and his store, or because he thought she was another clueless city slicker.Fortunately Joleen Jones had bounced into the general store in time to take some of the pressure off. Joleen with the hair, the clothes and the personality to draw attention the way sugar drew ants. Joleen, like so many other women, had come to Treasure Creek looking for the hunky tour guides described in theNow Womanmagazine article.In the short amount of time Penelope had been in Treasure Creek, she had realized she wasn't the only woman who had shown up to see what the men of Treasure Creek were all about; if they really were different.Penelope insisted on being married to the man of her choosing, rather than the man with the right business portfolio.Cold seeped into her bones, pulling her back to the present and her horrendous situation. Penelope pulled her coat a little closer and took a few careful steps on the trail.November in the Alaskan wilderness. She'd lived in Anchorage her entire life. Even if she had spent her time in the city, she should know something about the Alaskan wilderness, something more than the fact that it was cold. And dark.Yeah, she should know something&#151;like stay home where it was safe and warm.She hitched her backpack over her shoulder. At least she had jerky to eat, a few bottles of water and a rain poncho. And matches. If it came down to it, she could build a fire.A noise, just a rustle or maybe rocks shifting under someone's careful steps, caught her attention. She froze, and then turned cautiously, carefully. Chills were sweeping up and down her spine, tingling through her scalp and arms. She didn't want to be dinner for a bear. Or a mountain lion.How far back had she left the Jeep? It had to be miles. She'd been walking for hours. Not that going back would do her any good. Something had run out in front of the vehicle a few hours ago and she'd veered, sending the blasted thing over a small ledge and into a ditch. It wasn't going anywhere anytime soon.If only she hadn't allowed herself to get distracted. But instead of paying attention to the trail that passed for a road, she'd been daydreaming about the Chilkoot Pass, an icy trail over the mountains that had claimed many lives back in the late 1800s as settlers hurried to Alaska, hoping to find gold. Instead they'd found greedy traders, icy trails and death.She'd been imagining that trail, with steps cut into the ice. She'd been imagining how her ancestors might have felt as they walked into this frozen land, and how it might have changed their lives. She had imagined wagons and livestock left behind.She hadn't imagined crashing a rented Jeep or getting lost.She pulled her cell phone out of her pocket and she lifted it, hoping for a signal and still not getting one. So what was her story going to be, since &#34;lost because of her imagination&#34; didn't work?Maybe people would believe her if she said Bigfoot ran across the trail in front of the Jeep? She shivered again, imagining Bigfoot. Of course that was just a story. Bigfoot wasn't real. She was sure he wasn't. More than likely. She peeked around again, just to make sure she wasn't being followed.The November wind whipped through the pass, straight through her coat. She wasn't one of those settlers looking for gold in the Yukon, looking to make her fortune. She was a Lear, daughter of Herman Lear, one of the wealthiest men in Alaska. Or maybethewealthiest man in Alaska. She didn't need gold.She needed a map.She knew how to read a map. She knew more than anyone had ever given her credit for. She wasn't arm candy or an empty-headed socialite.That thought brought back leftover anger and her brother's words when he'd heard her plan. He had told her he didn't believe she could survive a day in the small town of Treasure Creek, let alone in the wilds of Alaska. But she had insisted she could. She didn't need fancy boutiques. She didn't need pedicures.At the moment she needed help. She yelled again, hoping she'd hear more than her own voice echoing back.Good gravy, Miss Mavy, what a mess. But surely someone would come looking for her. Amy James, the owner of the Alaska Treasure's Tour Company. Or that police chief; if he wasn't too busy trying to keep people from stealing maps. If he wasn't too busy looking for Tucker Lawson&#151;the last person to go missing in the Alaskan wilderness. Someone would realize she didn't come back to the Inn. Maybe the receptionist who had invited her to church when she first showed up in town. It had amazed her how easy it was to get to know people in a small town. Until someone rescued her, she'd do her best to get herself out of this mess. And then, when they found her, the headlines would be about the heiress who survived the wilds of Alaska, not the heiress who got lost.And eaten by bears.She shivered and started walking again. The trail she was on seemed to go south. Or she assumed she was heading south. With mountains towering around her, how was she supposed to know?She'd stay on the trail heading &#34;south&#34; and she'd pray.And she wouldn't get distracted. She wouldn't stop to look at trees that reminded her of the Treasure Creek treasure map that Amy's boys had found by accident several months ago.She picked her way along the trail that grew narrower as she walked. And it didn't look like the path most taken. It looked like a forgotten trail to nowhere.She was surrounded by high peaks, towering pines and shadows. A branch cracked somewhere in the brush to her left. Penelope stopped, frozen to the spot. She held her breath and waited.What if Bigfoot was real, not a legend?A mountain goat crashed through the brush and hit the trail twenty feet ahead of her. Now she knew who had made this trail. And it wasn't a guide or hikers.She kept walking, keeping her gaze on the trail, listening to the rush of a stream bouncing off rocks. Something crunched under her foot. She glanced down at the white stick and shivered. What if it had been the poor, lost lawyer, Tucker Lawson?He'd disappeared months ago. She'd heard all about him when she'd eaten dinner at Lizbet's Diner. She had loved sitting with the crowds that gathered there. She loved pretending to be a part of the community, a part of their group of friends. They had shared stories with her about the town, about the treasure they hoped to find, and the struggles they'd seen of late. She'd learned that Amy's husband had died suddenly a few months ago, leaving the town and Amy in mourning. She'd also heard how Tucker Lawson had come home to see his dying father but hadn't made it in time. Tucker had been flying his small plane when it crashed somewhere in the wilderness.According to the folks at the diner, the one good thing that had happened was an article about the town that had been meant to bring in tourists and instead it had focused on Treasure Creek's hunky bachelors bringing swarms of single women to the tiny town of seven hundred.Penelope had listened, thankful that they hadn't known who she was, because had they known they wouldn't have shared. But Penelope's heart had been touched by their plight and by the desire of the community to keep their little town strong.And she knew that she could help. Her family and small circle of friends thought that she was really only good for spa days and charity functions, but that's because they didn't understand her heart and how much she really wanted to help others.No one had ever really understood her. Obviously her dad understood her less than anyone, or he wouldn't have taken it upon himself to find her a husband, to insist that it was time for her to settle down.Treasure Creek had given her a chance to be the person she always wanted to be.Penelope stopped to brush stray tears from her cheeks. It was getting cold and she'd have to find shelter soon. And she could do that. She'd watched those survivor guys on TV. She had matches. She had food, water and a rain poncho. Little children survived in the mountains, surely she could, too.She could even fish. She'd done that on the guided tour she'd taken a couple days after getting to Treasure Creek. Oh, but one little problem: no fishing pole this time.A shadow flashed on the ground in ...--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Thanksgiving Groom (Love Inspired)", "price": 3.82, "salesRank": {"Books": 1017854}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QGNAmTjAL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373876386", "0373876262", "0373814984", "0373876149", "0373875622", "037381464X", "0373814941", "0373875304", "037381447X", "0373875487", "0373875177", "0373814860", "0373876084", "0373874464", "0373815913", "0373875029", "0373876459", "0373878354", "0373816391", "0373815549", "0373878052", "0373877056", "0373878907", "0373878656", "0373817525", "0373828675", "0373828713", "0373817371", "0373816219", "0373878540", "0373817029", "0373878532", "0373878478", "0373814380", "0373877765", "0373874642", "0373877943", "0373814097", "0373837798", "037381626X", "0373817509", "0373875363", "0373675534", "0373878389", "037387782X", "0373814925", "037387460X", "0373878435", "0373815719", "0373813155", "0373878249", "0373877587", "0373814445", "037382890X", "0373817088", "037387751X", "0373877226", "0373817207", "0373815891", "0373815190", "0373445245", "0373877862", "0373814151", "0373815093", "0373828632", "0373874766", "0373816855", "0373874545", "0373828276", "0373815581", "0373816928", "0373829256", "0373828314", "0373651589", "0373815751", "0373813961", "0373878044", "0373828292", "0373877684", "0373189230", "0373878494", "0373878591", "0373817401", "0373877544", "0373829523", "037387653X", "037381576X", "0373828497", "0373828977", "0373814348", "0373874383", "0373878311", "0373876424", "0373815867", "0373876254", "0373874529", "0373876610", "0373816235", "0373814208", "037387538X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["037381464X", "037381447X", "0373875304", "0373875177"]}}

{"asin": "0373875088", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "It was mid-December and the Coffee Break was busy, but not as busy as the street outside. Sarah Alpert drew her gaze away from the view through the wide glass window, where shoppers hurried about their seasonal tasks, to the little boy seated across the narrow table from her.Ali. Her heart warmed simply from looking at him. She loved children, which was not surprising given she was a kindergarten teacher. But this one was special. She handed a paper napkin across the red plastic tabletop to her five-year-old foster son and student. \"Hey, you have some hot chocolate on your chin.\"He grinned, the charmer he was, showing his heart-tugging grin and the dimple in his left cheek. He scrubbed at the wrong spot on his chin.Adoration filled her like Texas sunshine. She leaned forward, reaching over to rub at the right spot. Two swipes and the kid was clean. This sweetheart had proven to be the balm her wounded heart had needed. \"Are you ready?\"Ali hopped down from his chair. \"Yep. Can I call Dr. Mike yet?\"Mike. She tried not to flinch at that name.\"He hasn't called,\" Ali added. \"He's comin' home, you know.\"\"Yes, I heard something like that.\"\"'Cuz I tol' you.\"\"About a thousand times.\" She managed to keep a smile on her face as she stood. \"All right, sunshine, we have errands to do.\"\"Me and Dr. Mike are gonna get pizza and do lotsa stuff. We're buddies.\"Sarah focused on her little boy and pretended he hadn't brought up Mike. Distraction, that was the key. \"Which do you want to do first? Pick out our Christmas lights or mail our Christmas cards?\"\"The lights!\"Her heart melted a little more. Already he was her family. She couldn't wait for the adoption to go through. Then he would be hers. Really and truly hers. \"Coat on and zipped up. There's a cold wind out there.\"\"Yes, ma'am.\" Ali hopped down and his bright red sneakers&#151;his favorite color&#151;hit the floor with a squeak and a thump. His salute was the one Dr. Mike Montgomery had taught him. The two had met when Ali came in as a roadside-bomb casualty to Mike's MASH unit. The child had been injured, but his mother had been killed. Ali had formed a bond with Mike, and Mike had helped arrange to send Ali to the States for lifesaving surgery.Her heart twisted with an old pain. She and Mike had ended their engagement a year ago, but losing him would always hurt. She tucked that hurt away the best she could and put what she hoped was a big smile on her face.\"I get that.\" The little gentleman he was, Ali grabbed their garbage.\"Thank you.\" Sarah unhooked her jacket from the back of her chair and slipped into it, unable to take her eyes off the little boy as he trotted over to the receptacle near the door. He had to go up on tiptoe to dump it.She hefted the shopping bags from beneath their table, slid her purse strap higher on her shoulder and held out her hand to her foster son. She was thankful every day that he was thriving, after all his losses. His grandfather Marlon, who had lived next door, had passed away last month. And while Ali had little time to get to know his grandfather, it was another loss all the same.There were still shadows of his grief in his eyes that were always there, even when he smiled. Poor baby. She ran her fingertips through his fine, dark brown hair, hoping to comfort what could not be fixed.\"I get the door for you, Sarah.\" Ali trotted ahead of her, his sneakers thumping on the tile. He gave the door a mighty push.\"Thanks, kiddo. You are one strong boy.\" She complimented him as she sailed into the crisp overcast day and the busy sidewalk.\"I real strong now.\" Ali beamed with pride. His little fingers wrapped around her hand, holding on so tight she could feel his need.She held on tightly, too.\"Sarah, look!\" Ali fastened his deep soulful eyes on a soldier in desert fatigues, who was walking down the sidewalk. The little boy turned on his heels to watch the infantryman stride away. \"I'm gonna be a soldieranda doctor, just like Dr. Mike.\"Her knees shook with every step she took. How long did it take a broken heart to mend? How long for regret to fade away? It took all her strength to swallow her sadness and hide every bit of her pain. \"You couldn't pick a better man to be like.\"\"I know.\" Ali's confidence was simple and unshakable.Hers was not so sturdy. Life had not been the same without Mike. She missed him more than she cared to admit. Still, she had done her best to make something of her life without him.She knew Ali's next question would be about Dr. Mike, too. The boy was nothing if not persistent. Maybe it was best to try to distract him. \"What color house lights should we buy?\"\"Red.\" He thought a minute, tilting his head to one side. \"No, wait. I want blue.\"Sarah smiled. Ali lifted the sadness from her heart. Since this was his first American Christmas&#151;and their first one together&#151;she wanted to do it right. That's what she had to concentrate on: what mattered to her now.\"Dr. Mike!\"Ali ripped his hand from hers and barreled down the sidewalk, darting between families and a group of teenagers. He moved fast for a boy who'd just recovered from open-heart surgery! Sarah leaped after him, bags slapping against her knees as she caught up with him two steps before the busy intersection. She grabbed his hand, but Ali, the good, smart little boy he was, was already stopping on his own.Before she could drag enough air past the panic clutching her throat and the stitch in her side to set him straight about running off like that, Ali jumped up and down, waving his free hand.\"Dr. Mike! There's Dr. Mike!\"Sarah squinted across the street through the traffic searching the pedestrians for him. For Mike. It took only one second for her gaze to find him. Perhaps she would always recognize his straight, strong back and wide, dependable shoulders, his short, dark blond hair and that confident, lanky stride.Mike. Her pulse ground to a halt. All the ways she'd fallen out of love with him paled next to all the reasons she had fallen in love with him. He hadn't heard Ali's call above the rush of traffic as he stopped to look at a shop's window display. She could see his profile now; his handsome face was still the same with that square, honorable jaw and well-cut features.What a relief it was to see him again. Her toes tingled with happiness, warring impossibly with her sadness. He was back safe, unharmed and whole.Thank You, Lord.She sent the little prayer up with a piece of her heart. Just because Mike wasn't hers anymore didn't mean she couldn't pray for him. His happiness was more important than her own&#151;even now. She had tried to talk herself out of her feelings, but they hadn't budged over the last year that he'd been away. Perhaps because of the way they had broken up right before he had gone off to war.And now that she knew he was back home and unharmed, maybe she could let go of this sorrow. She planted her feet, hitched her purse back up on her shoulder and tightened her hold on Ali's hand. The light chose that moment to change to yellow and on to red. The traffic slowed and quieted, and Ali's \"Dr. Mike!\" must have reached the other side of the street because Mike looked up at the sound of his name. His eyes fastened to hers, just the way they used to do.It was just nostalgia; that's what she told herself as she jerked her gaze from his. That's the only reason she could give to explain the startle in her heart that felt, impossibly, like joy at seeing him again.I do not love him,she told herself. She wouldn't let herself again. She wished Mike well and that was all, nothing more. She would walk Ali right over to Mike and prove it to him.And to herself.Sarah. Mike stared in disbelief and then in dread as she started heading his way, with Ali's hand in hers. As she crossed the busy crosswalk, he had time to take her in. She looked different somehow. Her auburn hair was the same deep color and shone like silk in the afternoon sun. She was still as lovely as he'd remembered with her big blue eyes and soft, ready smile. She was wearing the wool coat she'd bought new around this time last year, right before they'd broken up. He couldn't quite put his finger on what exactly was different, but everything about her appeared a little brighter.At the back of his mind came a small voice, one he didn't want to listen to. It was sayingShe looks so good to you because you missed her so much.No, that was one voice he could not afford to listen to or encourage. He held his heart firm, dissolving away any lingering emotion. It was over and done with between him and Sarah. What he needed to focus on instead of their past was his little buddy&#151;the boy he'd come to think of as a son.It was a gift that Ali had come into his life. They'd had an instant connection in triage, when the nurse had called him over with worry in her eyes. Worry for a child caught in the middle of warfare. Ali had become his family over the last five months.He thought of the paperwork he had on his truck seat, ready for his lawyer. Ali's adoption papers. He wanted the little boy with everything he had left. This last tour had taken out a big chunk of him, but that didn't matter now.\"Hello, Mike.\" Sarah's quiet, sweet voice could reach right in and grab hold of his heart if he let it.\"Hello, Sarah.\" He couldn't look at her. Time had not healed his wounds. He squared his shoulders, at a loss. Maybe he ought to just concentrate on Ali. The little dark-haired, dark-eyed boy was running toward him. True joy lit that little face.\"Dr. Mike! You came! You came!\"\"Sure I did, buddy. Just like I promised. I didn't forget you.\" All the pain and exhaustion from this last year seemed to fade as the little boy flung out his arms and launched into the air. The world felt right as he caught the little fella in midair and swung him high before snuggling him to his chest.Thin arms wrapped around Mike's neck so tight, it hurt. He set the boy on the ground. \"Let me get a look at you. You're gettin' big.\"\"'Cuz I eat my veggies. But not broccoli.\" He...", "title": "Homefront Holiday (Homecoming Heroes, Book 6) (Love Inspired #472)", "price": 3.79, "salesRank": {"Books": 2018135}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517Qu8cacFL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373875045", "0373875002", "0373874928", "0373813740", "037387488X", "037387460X", "0373874235", "0373873492", "0373874324", "0373875657", "0373873379", "037381657X", "0373873255", "0373814445", "0373872534", "0373875037", "0373876254", "037381397X", "0373872615", "0373874367", "0373872704", "0373876327", "0373815921", "0373877757", "0373875177", "0373815891", "0373873050", "0373675615", "0373812531", "0373873077", "0373872933", "0373812973", "0373877633", "037381318X", "0373816561", "0373445369", "0373675534", "037381464X", "037387782X", "0373876084", "0373877765", "0373873999", "0373877838", "0373445202", "0373837798", "0373814348", "0373445288", "0373875649", "037365149X", "0373445172", "0373827997", "0373877706", "0373872828", "0373445245", "0373875053", "0373675461", "0373877587", "0373876386", "0373877846", "0373877269", "0373877641", "0373675143", "037387622X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0373873379", "0373874235", "0373875061", "0373877390"]}}

{"asin": "0373874960", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Texas attorney Jake Hopkins was severely allergic to two things: peanuts and a sweet young army nurse named Madeline Bright. TravisWylie, Jake's law partner, took the peanut problem seriously because he'd once had to call 9-1-1 when Jake suffered a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction during dinner at an Austin restaurant. But while Travis readily acknowledged that certain women possessed a knack for turning a man every which way but loose, he steadfastly maintained that Jake couldn't be allergic to a member of his own species.Jake knew better. There was nothing imaginary about the symptoms he suffered whenever he was in close proximity to Maddie. All he had to do was clap eyes on the chestnut-haired, blue-eyed beauty and his pulse raced, his throat closed up and his brain stalled out. Since that was pretty much what happened whenever Jake got too close to a peanut, he figured the evidence spoke for itself.It had been four years since the sudden onset of his peanut allergy, and in that time he'd learned to give a wide berth to foods containing even a trace of the offending legumes. In the past month, he'd trained himself to be just as assiduous about avoiding Maddie.\"Madeline,\" he said aloud, correcting himself as he swung his black BMW convertible into the grocery-store parking lot. Using her nickname was flirting with emotional intimacy, and Jake wasn't that kind of man anymore.Maybe he never reallyhadbeen that kind of man. His wife had hinted at that more than a few times when she was alive. Or maybe he and Rita just hadn't been a good match to begin with. Jake had known she was dissatisfied, and sometimes he wondered if she would have gone so far as to divorce him if a freak boating accident on Lake Travis hadn't ended her life.Poor Rita. For three years she'd clung to the stubborn belief that being married ought to temper Jake's passion for flying helicopters. She'd wanted him out of the army and out of the sky, but Jake was a second-generation West Point graduate, and a life without flying wasn't any kind of life at all.He'd had to adjust his thinking on that after he'd awoken at a combat support hospital in the Middle East and learned he'd never walk again, let alone fly. He'd been transferred to the Army Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany for more surgery, and a week later they'd drugged him up and loaded him on a hospital plane headed for Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C.Noah Bright, his copilot-gunner and his best friend for fifteen years, had already been shipped home to Texas in a flag-draped casket.Jake spent several weeks at Walter Reed. During that time, Rita visited twice. After she'd gone back to Texas, she drowned when a ski boat she was riding in capsized.Jake had missed her funeral, too.After numerous surgeries and skin grafts, Jake was finally sent home to Texas, where despite the gloomy predictions of his doctors, he learned to walk again. He wasn't terribly graceful about it, but with the help of a cane he could get around okay. Once he was, quite literally, back on his feet, his father had suggested law school.It was a cruel irony that if Rita had lived and stuck it out with Jake, she would now have everything she'd wanted. She'd be living deep in the heart of Texas with a newly minted civilian attorney who had ruthlessly trained himself not to think about helicopters. Jake didn't even look up when one flew overhead, which was no small achievement, considering where he lived. Ensconced in the beautiful Texas Hill Country, the town of Prairie Springs hugged the east side of Fort Bonnell, the largest military installation in the United States&#151;and home to the cavalry brigade that had trained Jake and Noah to do air combat in Apache attack helicopters.Impatient with himself for dwelling on the past, Jake shook his head and successfully flung those depressing memories out of it. But Maddie&#151;Madeline&#151;remained.He hated that he was having so little success fighting his insane attraction to her. He was no good for Madeline Bright, and it wasn't only because of what he'd done to Rita.\"And at five minutes before six o'clock, it's still a sweltering 102 degrees in downtown Austin,\" a radio announcer boomed over the end of an old Trisha Yearwood song. \"I don't have to point out that that's a little warm for the third day of September.\"\"Thendon'tpoint it out,\" Jake muttered, irritably punching the radio's Off button and wondering what the current temperature was here in Prairie Springs, thirty miles northwest of Austin. He loved his convertible, but when he'd left home a few minutes ago he'd been compelled to close the Beemer's roof and throttle up the air conditioner.He zipped past the handicapped parking spaces and found a spot near the end of a row. His bum leg was giving him trouble today, but the more it hurt, the more determined Jake was to walk like it didn't. The leg would never be any stronger, but Jake was convinced that pushing himself through the pain would eventually teach his nerves to quit squawking about it.He cut the ignition, opened his door and was assailed by a blast of dry heat that reminded him of his last tour of duty in the Middle East.As if his left leg didn't remind him of that every single day.His right leg had caught two bullets but healed nicely; his left was a different story. Bones had been shattered and a big chunk of muscle had been blown off his thigh&#151;and what the army surgeons had salvaged was barely enough to walk on.Jake reached behind his seat and grabbed a cane made from the root of a sumac tree.If you have to go, go in style,his father had always said, so Jake collected beautifully polished natural-wood walking sticks, which he changed to suit his mood.Maybe he should be using the black one today.He put his left foot on the ground and swung his right leg out before pushing himself to a standing position. Sucking in a sharp breath through clenched teeth, he accepted the first lightning bolt of pain and started walking.He'd gone just a few yards when a canary-yellow Ford Escape peeled around the corner and slid into an empty parking space just ahead of him. The door was immediately flung open and a pair of trim, tanned female legs emerged.Pretty. They reminded him of&#151;His heart skipped a beat when he saw the rest of the woman. Sure enough, it was Madeline Bright. Jake froze, hoping she hadn't noticed him.She hadn't. She closed her door and made for the store entrance with her usual energetic stride.Lost in admiration, Jake followed her with his eyes. She was all army&#151;capable and confident and strong as iron&#151;but she was still every inch a lady. She was fine-boned and tenderhearted and vulnerable in the most appealing ways. From the subtly swinging curves of her dark, shoulder-length hair, which she wore pulled back and above her collar when in uniform, to her slim pink toes, which Jake had glimpsed when she wore sandals, she was lovely.She was probably the only woman in the world who could make a bulky Army Combat Uniform look good, but Jake much preferred the way she was dressed today. She wore sand-colored cargo shorts, a white tank top that set off her tan, a yellow-patterned scarf in her hair and large sunglasses that made her look like someone the paparazzi ought to be chasing.Forgetting for a moment that she was his number-two allergen, Jake imagined pulling her onto his good knee and kissing her breathless. Then reason returned and advised him to beat a retreat to his car before Maddie happened to glance over her shoulder.It wasn't that she wouldn't be delighted to see him. Whenever they met, her blue eyes widened with pleasure and her bow-shaped mouth curved into a welcoming smile. As a kid, she'd had an obvious crush on Jake, her much older brother's best friend. It had been cute back then, but now she was an eminently desirable woman whom Jake had no business desiring, and that made her interest in him a very dangerous thing.In the month since her arrival in Prairie Springs, Jake hadn't been able to go anywhere without running into her or hearing people talk about her, and he was beginning to resent it. The whole world was Madeline Bright's oyster; couldn't she leave this one little Texas town tohim?Behind him, a car horn blared, reminding him that he was standing in the middle of the traffic lane. Afraid that the noise would prompt Maddie to turn around, he impulsively made for a rusted-out pickup truck. His half-formed thought was to lurk behind the truck's cab until Maddie was safely inside the store. But his bum leg chose that instant to give out and he pitched forward. Letting go of his cane, he broke his fall with his hands.Pain shot up his left leg as though a mad pianist was playing glissandos on his raw nerves. As the pavement seared his belly through his shirt, Jake closed his eyes and forced himself to draw slow, deep breaths. It was another second or two before he realized the deafening noise assaulting his ears was no pain-induced hallucination; he'd triggered the car alarm of the red Camry next to the truck.Oh, this just kept getting better and better. But at least he was safe from Maddie.\"Jake?\"At the sound of her voice, Jake groaned and squeezed his eyes more tightly shut. Better and better and better.\"Jake! Please tell me you're all right!\"He was aware that she crouched beside him, but he still flinched when she touched his shoulder. \"Give me a minute,\" he growled.\"Everything's going to be all right,\" she promised, pitching her voice to be heard over the Camry's alarm. She stroked the back of Jake's head, multiplying his misery with her gentle touch. \"Just tell me where it hurts.\"His eyes popped open. If he didn't quickly convince her that he was perfectly fine, she'd be running her hands all over his body, checking for broken bones.\"Madeline.\" He rolled over and sat up smartly.

{"asin": "0373876203", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "If she opened the clinic door, Maryann Jenner knew a gust of cold wind would blow inside that would smell of wood smoke, mostly from the stovepipes jutting up from the row of flat and peaked roofs that lined the main road into Treasure Creek, Alaska. As much as she liked the scent, not all of the patients did, so she left the door closed and instead looked out the window at the rugged, green mountains that edged the backside of this small tourist town. She still couldn't believe she was working in this postcard-perfect place.For the first time in her twenty-six years, she was beginning to feel like she had a chance at the peaceful life she wanted. She'd been an unwilling participant in other people's dramas&mdash;mostly her parent's&mdash;since she was born. Now she was far enough away that she could love her mother and father without being dragged into the soap operas that were their respective, disconnected lives. As though to celebrate her new life, she'd landed the perfect job, working with the ever so perfect Dr. Alex Havens in this perfect little clinic in paradise.&#34;Oh, no,&#34; she muttered to herself and took a quick glance over her shoulder to be sure the doctor was still in the back room examining six-year-old Johnny Short's ear infection. She had a bad habit of actually believing what she conjured up in her day dreams when looking out that window. Treasure Creek was wonderful, of course, but the pediatrician could be, she had to admit, a bit demanding at times. And particular. And downright testy about some things. He'd even been dubbed The Ice Man by her predecessor. And, since Maryann was now his nurse, it was apparently her job to make his days run smoothly.Ordinarily, that wasn't much of a problem. She was good at maintaining order. Besides, the doctor might be an ice man around adults, but children seemed to love him, and since they were his patients, everything moved along fine in their small clinic. She and Alex had figured out how to work together.But if the line of women marching up the slight hill toward them were the ones she thought they were, she was going to earn her salary today. The final thing he'd asked before hiring her last month was if she knew how to keep the fancy women away. She'd assured him she did, even though she was new in town and hadn't known what&mdash;or who&mdash;he was talking about.Today she knew. Several months ago,Now Womanmagazine had run an article on the bachelor tour guides in Treasure Creek, and before Maryann arrived, women had started swarming up here in hot pursuit of husbands. The locals called them fancy women because they looked like exotic tropical birds when set against the sturdy, practical dress of the local people.Maryann had never heard of the women attacking their target all together, though. Not like this. Alex was only a part-time guide with Alaska's Treasures tour company, earning just one brief mention in the article.Of course, he was completely single and unattached. But&mdash;oh, dear.The door flew open before Maryann had time to retreat. The smell of perfume followed the women inside, along with a surprising number of the rather large mosquitoes Alaska is famous for. She wasn't sure if it was the heavy floral scents that attracted these insects so late in the season, or if it was the red shine on the women's lips and nails. Either way, the fact that the women didn't complain about the bites they must be getting only proved how determined they were to be here.&#34;This is a pe-dia-tric clinic,&#34; Maryann raised herself up to her full five-foot-seven-inches and announced in her strictest nurse voice. &#34;Adult patients need to go down the street to Dr. Logan's clinic.&#34;She'd worked on that voice in her nurse's training, until it could silence a group of rowdy boys. It didn't even stop the women from chattering long enough for them to really listen to her. Of course, part of that could be because they were reaching up to try and tame their windblown hair.&#34;I have full-coverage insurance, so any doctor will see me.&#34; A showy blonde, with a dandelion head of bleached hair and the plumpest purple lips Maryann had ever seen, sat down in one of the few adult chairs in the waiting room and crossed her nylon-encased legs in a theatrical gesture. Then she looked at Maryann. &#34;It was part of my last divorce settlement. The doctor can do any test he wants on me. My ex will cover it if the insurance doesn't, so the doctor doesn't need to worry about the bill being paid.&#34;&#34;I just need a prescription refill,&#34; a young waif-like woman whispered as she slipped into one of the nearby children's chairs. She had long brown hair and a slight overbite. &#34;Do you know if the doctor likes to walk on the beach in the moonlight? I adore the beach. Not the Alaskan beach, of course&mdash;it's too rocky and cold&mdash;but, you know, the regular beach.&#34;The wind had ruffled the young woman and she nervously tried to pull her tangled hair into place.&#34;I can't&mdash;&#34; Maryann said, her voice rising slightly. She looked around. Eight women were in the room. None of them looked sick, especially since the cold outside had given their cheeks higher than normal color. Besides, together they were wearing enough gold jewelry to open a pawn shop. They had marched up here in full battle armor. But why had they come, now of all times&mdash;on this cold, blustery day?And then the realization hit her and she felt a twist in the pit of her stomach. It was her fault. She'd told her cousin last night how much his young patients would miss Alex after his contract expired at the end of the month. Her cousin remarked that if she wanted the man to stay in Treasure Creek, she needed to get him happily married to a local woman. Which led to the unfortunate remark by her that no woman with warm blood flowing through her veins would marry The Ice Man. Which led to her cousin saying that there was a match for everyone and Maryann could find someone for the doctor if she put her mind to it. After all, her cousin added, Maryann was good at managing other people's romances&mdash;hadn't her parents relied on her to help them find their next soul mates? And the ones after that?Unfortunately, she and her newly-engaged cousin, Karenna, had been eating hamburgers in Lizbet's Diner when they'd had their conversation. Someone must have overheard. Gossip traveled fast in a small town like this, and it often got twisted. Maryann knew she shouldn't have said anything about Alex. And worst of all, she had taken a guess at a woman who might suit him, and, even though it wasn't one of the fancy women, the whole thing must have resulted in today's sudden invasion.&#34;I'm sorry, but you'll have to leave,&#34; Maryann said, as she tried to herd the women to the door. They weren't budging. She didn't suppose she could call 911 over something like this. &#34;The doctor is in the exam room with a patient and&mdash;&#34;&#34;He can be my doctor any time,&#34; a woman with bouncy, copper ringlets said, as she wiggled out of Maryann's herd, walked over to a chair and sat down looking pleased with herself.The fancy women all giggled.Why did people seeking romance all become silly as teenagers, Maryann wondered. She raised her voice. &#34;What I'm trying to say is that there are no appointments left for today.&#34;She hoped that would do it.&#34;Or tomorrow either,&#34; she added quickly just in case. &#34;We're all booked.&#34;She really liked this job; she didn't want to be fired. Alex had promised to give her a good recommendation to his replacement. Well, it would be his temporary replacement. The agency had already said they could only send someone to fill in for a few months while they kept looking for a new scholarship doctor to take over the clinic for another three years. If they couldn't find someone, they would close the clinic in six months.Why did it all have to be so complicated? The children here needed a doctor. And Maryann didn't want to lose her job and return to the lower forty-eight. The obvious solution was to have Alex put down roots here in Treasure Creek. Of course, he'd have to want to stay. Her cousin was right about a wife being the answer, but&mdash;despite her earlier comments about him being The Ice Man&mdash;Maryann knew full well he could have his pick of brides. Some women would tell themselves he would thaw eventually; others might not care.No, he would be the one who was hard to please when it came to marriage. The nurse before her claimed Alex hadn't dated anyone in the time she'd known him. All he cared about was that clinic he was going to build in Los Angeles.&#34;I'm Delilah Carrington. I'm sure he'll see me,&#34; the copper ringlet woman said as she gave a grand wave with an arm wrapped in thin gold bracelets. Then she looked around and slowly frowned. &#34;I would think a doctor's office would be better equipped though. This place is a little old and scruffy, isn't it?&#34;She made it sound as though the patients regularly stuck their old chewing gum under the chairs bottoms, Maryann thought&mdash;which she was sure they did not, since she'd checked a time or two.&#34;He's a scholarship doctor,&#34; another of the women said, as though that explained any shabbiness. &#34;You know, the government pays for him to go to medical school and he has to work in a place like this for a few years to pay them back. All the poor kids do it.&#34;Maryann bristled at the implication that because Alex didn't have money, somehow that made him less of a success. He was a brilliant doctor. She'd known that after working the first day for him. Plus, he really cared about his little patients. He even treated the children from the Taiya Village, part of the Tlingit tribe, for free. If the town got another scholarship doctor, he probably wouldn't go out to the village at all. It was extra work, and not part of the agreement the doctors signed. That was another reason she wanted Alex to stay on here. The Tlingit kids needed him as much as the kids in Treasure Creek did, and probably more.&#34;The c...", "title": "Doctor Right (Love Inspired)", "price": 3.82, "salesRank": {"Books": 1609195}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hyddDEbNL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373876386", "0373876327", "0373876149", "0373876262", "0373876084", "0373814860", "0373817509", "0373828675", "0373651589", "0373828713", "0373878540", "0373878680", "0373874642", "0373814097", "0373877536", "0373878249", "0373877676", "0373828632", "0373813155", "0373874766", "0373814380", "0373815956", "0373827997", "0373814925", "0373817525", "037387250X", "0373876610", "0373874545", "0373878435", "0373814941", "037381447X", "0373875363", "0373871163", "0373876408", "0373878354", "0373878656", "0373785798", "037381528X", "0373814445", "0373878818", "037381397X", "037387524X", "0373828012", "B0072481W6", "1491013869", "0373814208", "0373816391", "0373817029", "0373817088", "0373875304", "0373877331", "0373815549", "0373817371", "0373813961", "0373877056", "0373875975", "0373816669", "0373875657", "0373875630", "0373878508", "0373874901", "037387393X", "0373874464", "0373878338", "0373875967", "0373815697", "0373875533", "0373816049", "037387426X", "037387796X", "037387801X", "0373877226", "0373876556", "0373817185", "0373815751", "0373876033", "0373816219", "0373877544", "0373814348", "0373828497", "0373877455", "0373815913", "037387538X", "0373877277", "0373827911", "0373878052", "0373815247", "0373877935", "0373875010", "0373878273", "0373816855", "0373874383", "0373876823", "0373814631", "037387622X", "0373816790", "0373828098", "0373814739", "0373877951", "0373878265"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0373876262", "0373876386"]}}

{"asin": "0373874979", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "\"I'm never going back.\"Dr. Kathryn Thatcher lay in the wooden porch swing, one arm slung across her eyes, her weary body soaking up sun.She hadn't been outside in such a long time she'd likely suffer second-degree burn. But the old family home at Wilson's Cove, Oklahoma, was tailor-made for lazing around, something the career-driven Dr. Thatcher never did. Until now.Three days and counting since she'd asked her medical director for a leave of absence and walked out. In truth, she wanted to resign, but he'd talked her out of it. Didn't matter. She was done, finished, through.Too many dead kids would do that to a person.\"A few days' rest and you'll be ready to go again. You're just tired.\"Kat's sister, Susan Renfro, sat on the top step of the long wooden porch, fingers laced around one knee, short dark unruly curls gleaming in the sunlight. She'd gained more weight, something Kat was not about to mention, considering Susan had never lost the extra twenty pounds from Sadie's birth four years ago. Three kids and a love for Southern comfort cooking had destroyed her sister's former cheerleader body.Who was she to talk? She'd added a few pounds, too, and her idea of exercise was running from one exam room to another.\"I'm more than tired, Suz,\" Kat said, though she couldn't deny the exhaustion. \"Maybe I made a mistake. Maybe I wasn't cut out for the medical profession.\"Memories of that last, terrible night pressed in. Kat shivered, still hearing the incessant rain hammering against the glass E.R. doors as ambulance after ambulance arrived, carrying victims from a five-car pileup on I-35. Thirty-six hours of blood and death, the worst of it being that all the fatalities were teenagers.\"A career in medicine is all you ever wanted, Kat. It's who you are.\"Lately, Kat wasn't sure who she was or what she wanted.Her older sister meant well, but she had no idea what an E.R. physician's life was like.Like most girls in Wilson's Cove, Susan married her high school sweetheart the summer after graduation and settled down around the 700 acre recreational lake, content to raise a family and take care of the family's rental cabins. She'd never gone to college, much less spent years working eighty hours a week until she was a zombie inside and out. She'd also never had to bear the news to parents that their beautiful, fresh-faced sixteen-year-old would never graduate from high school.\"Becoming a doctor was all I wanted as a kid. I'm not a kid anymore.\" She'd gone into medicine to save lives. Lately, all she'd done was sign death certificates.\"Then, what do you want?\"\"I don't know.\" There was the truth. She wanted to be happy. She wanted to feel joy. She wanted some intangible something that lacked definition. But if she admitted as much, she'd get a sermon. To her sister, life revolved around faith in God. That was fine for Susan. Religion hadn't worked so well for Kathryn. She and God had let each other down a long time ago.\"I'm being sued,\" she said.\"For what?\" Susan frowned and sat up straighter, ready to defend her baby sister. The sight warmed a cold spot inside of Kathryn. That was the great thing about family and one of the things she'd forgotten in her long absences from the cove.\"For being a doctor, I guess. I never even saw the patient, but I wrote and signed a discharge summary for his chart. Therefore, I am as liable for his death as the blood clot that killed him.\"\"That's ridiculous.\"\"Happens all the time.\" Another reason she was back in Wilson's Cove for good. She was tired of fighting the system.\"What are you going to do about it?\"\"Nothing I can do except let the lawyers duke it out.\" And sit by while her malpractice insurance jumped into yet another exorbitant bracket.\"Well, that's just wrong.\"Kat agreed, resentment boiling up inside her like a geyser. But if she followed that train of thought, she'd have a stroke.Closing her eyes, she tried not to think at all, a major problem for a woman whose mind never stopped churning. She was always thinking, always working, always planning. Sometimes she wanted to scream for her mind to shut up.April was here and, oh, how she loved the wild Oklahoma spring. With iron determination, she concentrated on the sights and sounds, anything to wash away the memories of her work in Oklahoma City.Lilacs and peach blossoms scented the air with gentle sweetness, and the hum of bees and other insects filled the afternoon. A butterfly hovered on one of Susan's geranium pots, a splash of yellow on fuchsia. Spring meant new beginnings, new growth, the rebirth of nature after a long, hard winter. For a silly moment, Kat wished she could be a tulip or a daffodil, ready to burst into newness.\"Guess who I saw this morning?\" Susan asked after a long period of silence.\"I give up,\" Kat said, lazily opened her eyes to peer into Susan's clear blue ones. \"Who?\"With a Cheshire Cat grin, Susan tugged at the toe of Kat's tennis shoe. \"Seth Washington. He asked about you.\"Kathryn's stomach quivered, and she sat up, pulling her foot away. Even though Susan had made a point of keeping her apprised of Seth's life ever since he moved back to Wilson's Cove last year, Kat tried never to think about the boy she'd loved in high school.\"How did he know I was here?\"\"Oh, come on, Kat. This is Wilson's Cove. Everyone in town knew you were home fifteen minutes after you stopped for gas at the Quick Mart.\"\"Oh.\" She'd almost forgotten the invisible information line that zinged from one side of the lake to the other, especially when the news concerned one of its own. The summer people came, camped, fished and left. But Kat's family had been here long before Wilson's Lake became a popular vacation spot, had owned most of the land at one time. The locals knew her, were proud of her, too, because she'd gone off to the big city to become a doctor.Well, now she was back. Wonder what they'd think of that?\"Aren't you curious about him?\" Susan was relentless when she got something into her head. And Seth Washington seemed to be her favorite subject whenever she talked to her baby sister.\"No.\" They'd had this conversation before.Kat finished off an icy glass of Susan's fresh lemonade to prove how uninterested she was. In the few times she'd been back to the cove, she'd made a pointed effort to avoid the new lake ranger. \"Not interested.\"\"Liar.\" Her sister swatted Kat's lily-white leg. \"I'm going to tell you anyway. Donna down at the Quick Mart says he's divorced. Has been for a long time, though he kept that quiet at first. He probably never got over you.\"Kat made a rude noise in the back of her throat. \"Don't be silly. That was years ago. He married someone else.\"\"So? He's divorced now. Rumor says his wife left him for another man, and that's why he quit the Houston police force and moved back to the cove.\"The rumor made Kat's chest ache. Seth was a great guy, or had been when she'd known him. He deserved better. \"Gossip is a sin, sister dear.\"For a second, Kat wished she hadn't mentioned sin. She didn't want to get Susan started on the church thing. They'd grown up in a Christian home and Susan had stayed true to her faith. Science and experience had taken Kat in a different direction, and the difference had caused more than one lively discussion between the sisters.But Susan didn't go there this time. Instead she stuck out her tongue. \"It's not gossip. It's the truth. And you want to hear everything I have to say about Seth Washington whether you admit it or not. Even the part about how good he looks in his lake ranger's uniform.\"Kat rolled her eyes heavenward, though the image of Seth in any kind of uniform was one she'd carried since first hearing he'd become a cop in Houston. But she and Seth had made their decision all those years ago and their painful history did not bear rehashing.\"Did you know his mama has Alzheimer's? She's in a nursing home in Tulsa.\"\"Oh, Suz.\" Seth and his mother had always been close. No doubt her illness was the real driving force behind his return to the cove. \"That's awful.\"\"Seth drives up to see her every week. I've heard Virgie doesn't even remember him.\"Kat fought against a tide of empathy and lost. The boy she remembered would be devastated by such a loss. She couldn't bear to think about it. Not now. Not when she didn't want to think about Seth at all.\"Is there any more lemonade in the fridge?\" she asked, and then pushed off the swing to saunter inside the house, letting the old-fashioned storm door clap shut resoundingly behind her. Even then she could hear her smart-aleck sister's tsk-tsking.A moment later Susan was in the kitchen beside her.Braced for more Seth updates, Kat was slightly deflated when Susan said, \"Are you still as inept in the kitchen as always?\"\"Yep. But I'm sharp with a scalpel. Could probably surgically dissect a chicken for you.\" She made a slashing motion with her hand, &#224; la Zorro. Then she paused in midslash and cocked her head toward the noise coming from the back of the house. \"What's that racket?\"\"Probably Shelby and Jon fighting over the remote.\"\"Oh, that's right. Today's Saturday. I forgot about the kids being here.\"Her sister gave her a long, sad look. \"Do you realize how pathetic that is? To forget about kids? To forget about the man you once loved? But to want to leave the profession that you gave all that up for?\"\"Don't start in, Susan. If I'd wanted kids or a husband I would have stayed here in Wilson's Cove instead of fighting my way into medical school.\"But shehadwanted those things. Seth. Children. Susan didn't know nearly as much as she thought she did. Regardless of the feminist movement and all the other hype, Kathryn had found out the hard way that a woman couldn't have everything.\"What are you going to do if you don't go back to medicine?\"Kat shrugged as she reached into the fridge for the big round pitcher filled with lemonade. Freshly sliced lemons bobbed like tiny yellow lifejackets.She thunked the pitcher onto the scarred p...", "title": "A Time to Heal (Love Inspired #461)", "price": 3.79, "salesRank": {"Books": 2239446}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SDQy3utKL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373814739", "0373816669", "0373651562", "0373878249", "0373817088", "0373815891", "0373876386", "0373815581", "0373813155", "0373876866", "0373817029", "0373816561", "0373814062", "037387426X", "0373816219", "0373873360", "0373813996", "0373874448", "0373876556", "0373875711", "0373817207", "0373871872", "0373817169", "0373815751", "0373878052", "037387491X", "0373816391", "0373877544", "0373877226", "0373675356", "0373444958", "0373877943", "0373816987", "037381318X", "0373874235", "0373874111", "0373813945", "0373877641", "0373445121", "0373814631", "0373877455", "0373816286", "0373873379", "0373877765", "0373675259", "0373877706", "037381528X", "0373816855", "0373877528", "0373877587", "0373877404", "0373877463", "0373816685", "0373445180", "0373445113", "0373815352", "0373813503"]}}

{"asin": "037387491X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The phone was ringing inside her apartment, but Rebecca McKaslin stepped out into the late-summer evening anyway. Thank goodness for caller ID. Why was Chris calling? He knew she wouldn't talk to him ever again&#151;mostly because she'd told him so. How many times would she have to let it ring before he got a clue?Exasperated, she yanked the door shut and the lock gave a metallic click. See, this was the reason she'd adopted her newly instated No Man policy. Men, they didn't call when you wanted them to, but when you didn't want them to callever,then, voil&#224;, the phone rang off the hook.Well, she was a free and independent woman these days and she wasn't even going to let the thought of her ex-boyfriend bug her. It was too bad that he had regrets, because she didn't, thank you very much. She went to hike her purse strap higher on her shoulder&#151;Wait. No purse strap.No purse. How had she forgotten it? It was right there by the door on the little hallway table where the phone had been ringing with Chris's number flashing away.No biggie, she told herself and lifted her hand to sort through her keys.Wait. No keys. She stared at her empty hand. Had she left her key ring inside, too? Oh, probably. Talk about being an airhead, Rebecca. If she wasn't careful, she was going to turn into her sister Ava who, as adorable as she was, forgot everything.Okay, this was a major problem. How was she going to drive the car? Pick up the pizza? Get to her sister's house in time to babysit?Good going, Rebecca. Way to start off the evening. She folded a stray lock of brown hair out of her eyes. She tried the doorknob just in case it wasn't really locked and that click had been a figment of her imagination.Nope. The knob didn't turn. Wasn't that just her luck? If she had her purse, she would have her cell phone and so a quick call to someone in her family would fix this in a jiffy. If it wasn't after five o'clock on a Friday, she could bother her neighbor Ephraim, but he was off at a church function.So who did that leave? Asking a neighbor she didn't know to borrow a phone? She hadn't lived in this complex long. She didn't know her neighbors, other than Ephraim, but she was going to have to start knocking on doors. As she was shy, that was not something she was looking forward to. Although judging by the quiet stillness of the complex, most of them probably wouldn't be home.On a brighter note, the phone inside her apartment had stopped ringing. Was Chris finally giving up? Getting a hint? Finding a clue?A girl could always hope. Because she was done with dudes for good&#151;or at least the next decade. Prince Charming could come walking around the corner and she would be Fort Knox. Her affections impenetrable. Her No Man policy was unshakable.\"You need any help?\" A man's voice came out of nowhere right behind her.Her heart jumped hard enough to make it to the moon and back. She turned around and clutched the porch rail to steady herself. There was a drop-dead handsome guy standing on her walkway&#151;and not just everyday ordinary handsome, either. But twenty on a scale of ten. Really wow. Shehadto be dreaming, right? She blinked, but nope, the gorgeous guy was still standing there as real as could be.He was a big athletic-looking guy&#151;not heavily muscled, but not lanky, either. He was tall with blond hair and a wholesome, guy-next-door grin. He wore a loose sport T-shirt and basketball shorts. Friendly looking.\"I saw you lock yourself out.\" He had a wholesome smile, too, one that brought out a dimple in his right cheek and an honest sparkle in his dark eyes. He was also carrying a cardboard box in the crook of his arm. \"I wasn't peeping or anything. I was unloading my truck and I couldn't help noticing. I'm moving in next door.\"\"Oh, you're Ephraim's new roommate?\"\"Guilty. You must be Rebecca. He's talked about you. Only good things, though. Said to look you up if I wanted to join a Bible study group.\"\"I'd be happy to give you the information, except&#151;\"\"All your information is inside?\"\"Yep.\"\"Isn't that always how it goes?\" He flashed her a hundred-watt grin. \"You look like you're on your way somewhere.\"\"Yep, in a hurry without the keys to start my car.\"\"That's gotta spell trouble.\" He was, as her sister Ava would say, super-duper.But was she noticing? No. It was good to know her No Man policy was firmly in place. Talk about peace of mind. She crossed her arms over her heart like a shield. \"Trouble? That's the least of it. I'm running late, and now this. It's just been one of those days of doom.\"\"Hey, I have those too now and then.\"There was something about that friendly smile, Rebecca decided as she found herself smiling back. If there really was a Prince Charming, then this man would be him.\"A pretty girl like you is probably rushing out for a date, right?\"\"I'm pleading the fifth on that one.\"\"I see.\" His voice was warm as if it was a smile all on its own. \"I'm Chad, by the way. Chad Lawson.\"\"Rebecca McKaslin.\"\"Well, Rebecca. Do you have a spare key lying around?\"\"No. I'm not that organized.\" Mostly because she wasn't usually this absentminded. \"And if I did, I wouldn't be standing here staring like I've lost my mind.\"\"That's not how I would describe you.\"\"Then you are too kind.\" She shaded her eyes with her hand. \"I hate to bother you, but could I use your phone?\"\"That would be no bother at all.\" There went that dimple, flashing at her. He had the knack of putting people at ease. \"You're going to call a locksmith?\"\"Or my sister for the key. It's her condo. I rent from her. She's not going to be happy with me. Katherine is pregnant and on bed rest.\"\"Is she going to be okay?\"Rebecca sighed. Right now she should start collecting all the reasons why she wasn't going to like Chad, but then he had to go and ask the perfect question. She had to like anyone who asked about her family. \"It looks as if she and the baby will be fine, but you never know. It's some high blood pressure problem.\"\"I'll keep her in my prayers.\" He seemed sincere standing there with the sunlight bronzing him and concern on his chiseled face. \"You don't want to disturb her by getting that key. I've got an idea.\"\"What kind of idea?\" This ought to be interesting. She squinted at him, trying to figure out why he was being so nice. Maybe he was just a nice guy&#151;or liked people to think he was. A smart girl would be on guard for that kind of thing.\"How about I break in for you?\"\"Break in? Uh, that has the wordbreakin it.\"\"Sure, but not literally.\" There was something reassuring about him as he set down the cardboard box he carried on the concrete walkway. \"I'm assuming that your unit has a sliding-glass door like ours does?\"\"Sure, but&#151;\"\"Then trust me.\"Wow, he had the most honest eyes. Good thing there wasn't a single bit of interest. Nada. Zero on a scale of ten.\"Wait here. I'll be right back.\" He had classic features, a confident rugged air to him, tousled blond hair and wide shoulders. In short: gorgeous.Didn't that spell trouble?Not for me, she reminded herself. She wanted to find fault with him but she couldn't. She didn't want to like the way two dimples bracketed his friendly, open smile or the dependable line of his wide shoulders as he turned and disappeared around the corner of her condo.Was he a locksmith or something? She checked her watch; she had called in a pizza order for pickup and it was probably about ready. She didn't want the cheesy sticks to dry out. How long did it take for a locksmith to pick a lock, or whatever it was that they did?She tried not to think about how disappointed little Tyler was going to be if they didn't have the pizza night she'd promised him. Hey, she was going to be disappointed, too, because she loved her nights with the munchkins. Family was everything to her. Simply everything.The warm wind gusted gently, bringing the scent of roses from the garden around back. She let the fragrance wash through her. Just the sweet old-fashioned scent soothed her. Why was she so tense?It wasn't only from Chris's barrage of calls. He'd done this before when they were off again. She was managing through the stress. It would stop, if all went according to her experience with him. No, what bothered her was much more complex, and it troubled her every time she sat still long enough to feel it.She ought to be moving forward with her life instead of being stuck in place. Everything felt off. She hated feeling like this, lost and at loose ends. Why was it still bugging her? Hadn't she come to a good solution last night in prayer?Yes. She was letting go and letting God.Another phone started to ring again&#151;she recognized the electronic jingle of her cell phone muffled by the thick door. No doubt it was Chris again, persistent, as always.I'm giving this up to you, too, Lord. She looked heavenward and heard the phone cut off&#151;and start ringing again. Not the best of signs, but her faith was strong.I trust You with this. I know You have a plan.And speaking of a plan, where had the neighbor guy gone? There wasn't one sign of Chad. Then again, there wasn't the sound of breaking glass, either. That had to be a good thing.Suddenly her doorknob rattled and turned. She startled in surprise as the door swung open to reveal Chad standing in her foyer.\"What? How did you&#151;\" She leaned against the rail as he joined her on the porch. \"What did you do?\"\"I went to your patio and popped open the sliding-glass door.\"That fazed her. \"But it was locked.\"\"Yep. Don't worry, your door doesn't have a scratch on it.\"\"But how did you open it?\"\"Trade secret. I used to work summers for my uncle. He owns a glass shop.\" Chad shrugged those wonderful shoulders of his. Washed in sunlight and charm, he looked like a wholesome, decent man. \"You really should get a dowel for the track. That will keep burglars from doing the same thing I did.\"\"Great.

{"asin": "0373876998", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Kent County, Delaware&#133;WinterAnna Yoder carried an open can of robin&#39;s egg-blue paint carefully through the big farmhouse kitchen, down the hall and into the bedroom across from her mother&#39;s room. Her sister, Susanna, trailed two steps behind, a paintbrush in each hand.&#34;I want to paint,&#34; Susanna proclaimed for the fourth time. &#34;I can paint good. Can I paint, Anna? Can I?&#34;Anna glanced over her shoulder at her younger sister, and nodded patiently. &#34;Yes, you can paint. But not right now. I&#39;m cutting in and it&#39;s tricky not getting paint on the floor or the ceiling. You can help with the rolling later.&#34;&#34;Ya,&#34;Susanna agreed, and her round face lit up in a huge smile as she bounced from one bare foot to the other and waved the paintbrushes in the air. &#34;I&#39;m the goodest painter!&#34;Anna chuckled. &#34;I&#39;m sure you are thebestpainter.&#34;Susanna was nothing, if not enthusiastic. Of her six sisters, Susanna was the dearest and the one toward which Anna felt most protective. Sweet, funny Susanna was the baby of the family and had been born with Down syndrome. Their Dat had always called her one of God&#39;s special children; at eighteen, Susanna still possessed the innocence of a girl of nine or ten.Fortunately, for all the tasks that came hard to Susanna, such as reading, sewing or cooking, the Lord had blessed her with a bottomless well of special gifts. Susanna could soothe a crying baby better than any of them; she always knew when it was going to rain, and she had a rare ability to see through the complications of life to find the simple and shining truth. And sometimes, when things weren&#39;t going well, when the cow had gone dry or the garden was withering for lack of rain, Susanna could fill the house with laughter and remind them all that there was always hope in God&#39;s great plan.Still, keeping track of Susanna and running the household was a big responsibility, one that Anna felt doubly, with Mam off to Ohio to bring Anna&#39;s grandmother, great aunt and sisters, Rebecca and Leah, home. Susanna and Anna would be on their own for several days. Their sister Ruth and her husband, Eli, who lived just across the field, had gone to a wedding in Pennsylvania. Irwin, the boy who lived with them, had accompanied their sister Miriam and her husband, Charley, to an auction in Virginia. Not that Anna didn&#39;t have help. Eli&#39;s cousin was pitching in with the milking and the outside chores, but Anna still had a lot to do. And not a lot of time to get it all done.Anna had promised Mam to have the house spic-and-span when she returned home, and she took the responsibility seriously. Having both Miriam and Ruth marry and move out in November had been a big change, but bringing Gross-mama and Aunt Jezebel into the house would be an even bigger change. Grossmama was no longer able to live on her own. Anna understood that, and she knew why her mother felt responsible for Dat&#39;s aging mother, especially now that he was gone. The trouble was, Grossmama and Mam had never gotten along, and with the onset of Alzheimer&#39;s, Anna doubted that the situation would improve. Luckily, everyone adored Grossmama&#39;s younger sister, Jezebel; unlike Grossmama, Aunt Jezebel was easygoing and would fit smoothly into the household.&#34;We&#39;re paintin&#39; because Grossmama&#39;s coming,&#34; Susanna chirped. Her speech wasn&#39;t always perfect, but her family understood every word she said. &#34;She baked me a gingerbread man.&#34;&#34;Ya,&#34;Anna agreed. &#34;She did.&#34; Susanna was the one person in the household who her grandmother never found fault with, and that was a good thing. If Grossmama could see how precious Susanna was, she couldn&#39;t be that bad, could she?Once, when she was visiting years ago, Grossmama had spent the afternoon baking cookies and had made Susanna a gingerbread man with raisin eyes, a cranberry nose and a marshmallow beard. Susanna had never forgotten, and whenever their grandmother was mentioned, Susanna reminded them of the gingerbread treat.Grossmama had fallen on the stairs at her house the previous year, fracturing a hip, so Mam hadn&#39;t wanted her climbing the steps to a second-floor bedroom here. Instead, they&#39;d decided to move Anna and Susanna upstairs to join Leah and Rebecca in the dormitory-style chamber over the kitchen. Grossmama and Aunt Jezebel could share this large downstairs room just a few feet away from the bathroom.It was a lovely room, with tall windows and plenty of room for two beds, a chest of drawers and a rocking chair. Anna knew that Grossmama and Aunt Jezebel would be comfortable here&#133;except for the color. Anna couldn&#39;t remember which of her sisters had chosen the original color for the walls, but Grossmama hated it. She&#39;d made a fuss when Mam had written to explain the new arrangements. Grossmama said that she could never sleep one night in a bed surrounded by fancy &#34;English&#34; walls.By saying &#34;English,&#34; Anna understood that her grandmother meant &#34;not Plain.&#34; To Grossmama, white was properly Plain; blue was Plain. Since the ceiling, the window trim, the doors and the fireplace mantel were white, blue was the color in Anna&#39;s paint can. Actually, Anna didn&#39;t see anything improper about the color the room was now. The muted purple was closer to lavender, and she had a lavender dress and cape that she really loved. But once Grossmama set her mind on a thing or against it, there was no changing it.Standing in the bedroom now, staring at the walls, Anna wished Ruth was there. Ruth was a good painter. Anna prided herself on her skill at cooking, perhaps more than she should have, but she knew that her painting ability was sketchy at best. But, since the choice was between Susanna or her, Anna knew who had to paint the room.Of course, she&#39;d meant to get started sooner, but the week had gotten away from her. Susanna had a dentist appointment on Monday, which took all afternoon by the time they had to wait for the driver. On Tuesday, there had been extra eggs, which needed to go to Spence&#39;s Auction and Bazaar. Normally, they didn&#39;t go to Spence&#39;s in the winter months, but Aunt Martha and Dorcas had opened a baked-goods stand. Anna had taken the opportunity to leave Susanna with their oldest sister, Johanna, so that she could go with Aunt Martha to sell her eggs and jams.Now it was Wednesday. After Mam left at dawn, Anna and Susanna had spent the morning scrubbing, dusting, polishing and setting her yeast dough to rise. Now there were no more excuses. Anna had to start painting if she wanted to be finished on time. Because they were alone, Anna wore her oldest dress, the one with the blackberry stains, and had covered her hair&#151;not with a proper whitekapp,but with a blue scarf that Irwin&#39;s terrier had chewed holes in.Knowing that Susanna would be certain to lean against a freshly painted wall, Anna had made sure that Susanna&#39;s clothing was equally worn. That way, if the dresses were ruined it wouldn&#39;t be a waste. Anna&#39;s final precaution was to remove her shoes and stockings and ask Susanna to do the same. Paint would scrub off bare feet. Black stockings and sneakers wouldn&#39;t be so lucky.Gingerly setting the can on the little shelf on the ladder, Anna climbed the rickety rungs, dipped her brush in the can and began to carefully paint along the wall, just below the ceiling. She&#39;d barely gone two feet when Susanna announced that she was hungry. &#34;Wait a little,&#34; Anna coaxed. &#34;It&#39;s still early. When I get as far as the window, we&#39;ll have some lunch.&#34;&#34;But, Anna, I&#39;m hungrynow.&#39;&#34;&#34;All right. Go and fix yourself a honey biscuit.&#34;&#34;&#39;Fff&#133;thirsty, too,&#34; she said, struggling to pronounce the word properly.&#34;Milk or tea. You don&#39;t need my help.&#34;&#34;I&#39;ll make you a biscuit, too.&#34;&#34;Ne.I&#39;ll eat later. Don&#39;t wander off,&#34; she cautioned her sister. &#34;Stay in the house.&#34; Susanna was capable of taking care of herself on the farm, but it was cold today, with snow flurries in the forecast, and she didn&#39;t always remember to wear her coat. It wouldn&#39;t do for Mam to come home and find Susanna sick with a cold.Anna continued to paint. The blue covered the lavender better than she thought it would. It would need a second coat, but she had expected as much. As she carefully brushed paint on the wall in a line along the ceiling&#39;s edge, Anna began to hum and then to sing one of her favoritefast tunesfrom theLiedersammlung.She liked to sing when she was alone. Her voice wasn&#39;t as good as Johanna&#39;s or Ruth&#39;s, but singing made her feel bubbly inside. And now, with only Susanna to hear, she could sing as loudly as she wanted. If she was a bit off-key, her little sister wouldn&#39;t complain.&#34;Anna? Maybe we come at a bad time?&#34;Startled by a deep male voice, Anna stopped singing midword and spun around, holding onto the ladder with her free hand. &#34;Samuel!&#34;Their nearest neighbor, the widower Samuel Mast, stood inside the bedroom holding his youngest daughter, Mae, by the hand. Mortified by her appearance and imagining how awful her singing must have sounded, Anna wanted to shrink up and hide behind the paint can. Of all the people to catch her in such a condition, it had to be Samuel Mast. Tall, broad-shouldered, handsome Samuel Mast. Anna&#39;s cheeks felt as though they were on fire, and she knew she must be as flame-colored as a ripe tomato.&#34;I remembered what you said.&#34; Susanna hopped from one foot to the other in the doorway. &#34;I didn&#39;t go outside. Let Samuel and Mae in.&#34; She beamed.&#34;You&#39;re busy,&#34; Samuel said, tugging on Mae&#39;s hand. &#34;We can come back another&#151;&#34;&#34;Ne,&#34; Anna interrupted, setting her brush carefully across the paint can and coming down the ladder. &#34;Just&#133;you surprised me.&#34; She tried to cover her e...", "title": "Anna's Gift (Love Inspired)", "price": 3.82, "salesRank": {"Books": 206354}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ftJUIbDTL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373877412", "037381657X", "0373876246", "0373876688", "0373878125", "0373878486", "0373878893", "0373877099", "0373876793", "0373814917", "0373877579", "0373875835", "0373877811", "0373816960", "0373876378", "0373817347", "0373828888", "1420131885", "1401688705", "0373082576", "0373828683", "0373445563", "0764212540", "0062204475", "0373817568", "0307729982", "0425253759", "1420121707", "0764209787", "1620291460", "0373878257", "0764209809", "1616260858", "1420121693", "0310335817", "1620291436", "1420121715", "0615626432", "0373082355", "1620291444", "0615621600", "1620291479", "1616260866", "0615621953", "0764209795", "0615636586", "0736957340", "0615618820", "0425253562", "0736957367", "0615654134", "1595548726", "1478313781", "1620291452", "0736938621", "0373879024", "0310319986", "0307730042", "1603745068", "0764212451", "0307730069", "B00B2RYVPA", "0764211986", "0373878842", "061568940X", "0062204467", "0373442556", "0615702686", "0062242563", "0310335159", "0310330459", "0615802931", "0373777353", "0800720946", "0062204408", "0062204521", "0373777868", "0758291728", "1420133071", "0451237978", "0310335124", "0307730026", "0764209779", "1401685676", "0983572240", "0736926267", "0310335108", "1595547762", "0736938664", "0778314723", "0373877528", "061583891X", "1426707630", "0615809529", "0425253295", "142013356X", "0800719891", "B00B1KKO36", "0373829361"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0373878486", "037381691X", "037381657X", "0373876688"]}}

{"asin": "0373876831", "description": "I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten&#133;Joel2:25Lyndon Point, Washington StateLucie Adams slammed on the brakes. A car honked behind her.The sight of the crumbling Victorian at the corner ofMain and Sea Breeze Way stole her breath.uMa-maaaa!&#34;When the panic in her five-year-old daughter&#39;s voice registered, she murmured, &#34;Sorry, Chloe, honey. It&#39;s okay. You can relax.&#34;Lucie stared some more. Then, wearing a satisfied grin, she eased her foot off the brake.So far so good.As she rounded the corner, excitement bubbled inside her. She continued to stare in her rearview mirror at the house&#151;the very shabby, once-upon-a-time magnificent Queen Anne Victorian she had discovered on this, her first drive through her soon-to-be new hometown.The house was perfect, but it needed so much work. She only had five months&#39; worth of funds in her savings account. She&#39;d thought that would see her through, but now&#133;she&#39;d need to make it stretch. She&#39;d have to rethink the pricey extended-stay suite hotel where she and Chloe were rooming.Her excitement grew.Up ahead, real estate agent Edna Lyndon&#39;s zippy, red convertible continued down the street. In her final peek in the mirror as she followed Edna, Lucie spied the corner of the wraparound porch, the turret above, the rusted iron fence hemming in the overgrown garden, and fell totally in love.&#34;It&#39;s perfect,&#34; she whispered.While the place was a mess, with peeling paint, faded and sagging shutters, broken gingerbread trim on the porch and missing fish-scale shingles on the pitched peak of the turret, Lucie knew she could turn the place into the home of her dreams&#151;Nope! I don&#39;t have to turn it into anything.The Victorian alreadywasthe home of her dreams. Lucie wanted a fixer-upper with lots of character for her and Chloe to live in, and to be the site for her new endeavor, the quilt and fabric shop she planned to open in Lyndon Point. This bedraggled treasure would clean up great.Her heartbeat sped up and hope kicked into high gear. She couldn&#39;t wait to ask Edna about the place.The sixty-something Realtor pulled into a small, crowded parking lot on Sea Breeze Way, across from the Victorian on the corner. Lucie followed. As they crawled past the lines of cars, they found an empty spot&#151;the only one&#151;in the farthest row. Edna gestured for Lucie to roll down her window.&#34;You take this one, dear,&#34; she called out. &#34;Shirley Wilcox will let me park behind her Tea &amp; Sympathy shop about a block away&#151;it&#39;s a wonderful little place. You&#39;ll have to stop in when you get a chance.&#34; She waved toward the parking spot. &#34;Go ahead. Take this one. It&#39;ll only take a minute for me to get back. I&#39;ll meet you girls inside.&#34;Since Lucie had to wrestle her hungry five-year-old out of the booster seat and herd her into the diner, one of those complex mothering maneuvers she performed hourly, she thanked Edna and focused on squeezing in between the SUVs on either side of the parking space. She grabbed her purse, freed Chloe, gripped the little hand and turned toward the quaint eatery.At Lucie&#39;s side Chloe hippety-hopped, her pink sun hat flopping along, practically swallowing her little face in its shadow. Chloe loved the hat. Lucie? Not so much. But in view of their cross-country move to Washington State and all the disruption it had forced on the five-year-old, Lucie figured the hat wasn&#39;t worth a battle.&#34;Mama! I want chicken nuggets.&#34; Chloe rarely whined, but she was coming close now. &#34;D&#39;you think they got&#151;&#34;&#34;Theyhave,Chloe.&#34;&#34;Oh, goody! That&#39;s what I want. With barber cube sauce.&#34;Sigh.&#34;I don&#39;t know if they have chicken nuggets. I meant the right way to say it is &#39;Do you think theyhave,&#39;not &#39;D&#39;you think they got&#39;&#151;&#34;&#34;But, Mama!&#34; Chloe&#39;s voice rose in pitch and volume. &#34;It&#39;s all the same.&#34;&#34;The meaning may be the same, but how you say it matters, too.&#34;Chloe yanked her hand free, crossed her arms and squared her chin. She glared, and when Lucie didn&#39;t react immediately, she stomped over to the bubblegum dispenser at the left of the diner&#39;s door. But Chloe rarely forgot an ultimate goal. &#34;I want nuggets,&#34; she shot over her shoulder. &#34;With barber cube sauce.&#34;Lucie got down to her hungry and cranky daughter&#39;s level. &#34;I can&#39;t promise nuggets withbarbecuesauce. They might have them, and they might not. But I know they&#39;ll have at least one yummy lunch choice for you. And, after we eat, how about we go down to the beach?&#34;Chloe&#39;s distinctive blue-gray eyes widened. &#34;The beach?&#34;&#34;Mmm-hmm. We can go right after we eat.&#34;&#34;Can we swim?&#34;&#34;Oh, I don&#39;t think you want to do that. The water here&#39;s awfully cold.&#34; Lucie straightened and, grabbing Chloe&#39;s hand again, turned toward the diner&#39;s door. &#34;Let&#39;s check it out&#151;oof!&#34;She&#39;d crashed into a wall. With hands. That held her by the shoulders. Kept her from falling. Sent shivers right through her. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry&#133; &#34;As she looked up, her stomach took a sickening dive. Her words dried in her throat.Oh, no. Nonononono&#151;This was too soon, too fast. She wasn&#39;t ready yet. Would she ever have been?From the moment she&#39;d seen the mayor&#39;s picture on the Lyndon Point webpage, Lucie had known this time would come.She never thought it would come almost the minute she arrived.She stared, her stomach knotted and she felt as though the blood in her veins had turned to ice. Everything around her slowed. The brilliant blues and piney emerald greens of the Pacific Northwest faded to gray. Nothing existed but the man staring at her, holding her shoulders.Long, strained seconds oozed by. Lucie felt the urge to run, to grab Chloe and hide her, to protect her daughter from the potential pain she might face. But she couldn&#39;t run. She had nowhere to go. This was why she&#39;d come so far, the real reason behind her move.Lucie stood frozen in place, staring into the familiar blue-gray eyes, eyes her daughter had inherited from.From the man before her.The man Lucie hadn&#39;t seen in six years, hadn&#39;t managed to find in all that time. The guy she&#39;d finally located in Washington State.She&#39;d crossed the continent to introduce him to his daughter.An eternity later, the warmth of his strong, steady hands penetrated the chill in Lucie. Among the myriad of emotions at odds within her, she identified one she hadn&#39;t expected. Yearning opened up, tugged at her, teased her memory, reminding her of the fragile new love she&#39;d once felt.For him.No!She couldn&#39;t go there. That all had died the day&#151; Lucie shuddered, breaking the spell he&#39;d cast on her. Eyes glued to the face from her past, she longed for the time she&#39;d hoped to have to prepare herself and Chloe, but that had now vanished. Her past and her present had collided.&#34;Ryder,&#34; she whispered.Confusion crossed his features. His intense eyes narrowed. A hint of a smile brightened the ruggedly handsome features when he made the connection. &#34;Cindy.?&#34;As his rich baritone voice sounded out the name no one else called her, Lucie tried to draw breath, but her lungs felt squeezed dry. She shook her head, unable to tear her gaze away from the man she&#39;d never forgotten. She wanted to speak, but knew nothing would come out.&#34;My mama&#39;s not Cindy, mister. She&#39;s Lucie. Lucie Adams.&#34;Ryder&#39;s blue-gray gaze shot down to Chloe. His eyes widened in shock, homed in on the little girl.In the long, slow moments that followed, he continued to stare, from Lucie to Chloe, who&#39;d moved back to the bubblegum machine. His jaw gaped. He snapped it shut and narrowed his gaze.That icy stare lasered into her. &#34;Her.mama?&#34;Lucie stepped between Ryder and Chloe to protect her daughter, if only momentarily. She tipped up her chin.&#34;Yes.&#34;He ran a hand down his face, drew in a rough breath, pinned her with a piercing glare. &#34;I don&#39;t need my accounting degree to do this kind of math. I might not know much about little kids, but what&#39;s adding up here doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out. You really do flit around like the butterfly you once said you felt like. Didn&#39;t take you long to replace me, did it?&#34;Lucie felt gut-punched, hurt to the very core. She shook her head, fought back the tears, but because Chloe was with them, she couldn&#39;t argue in her own defense.Before she could muster the strength to speak, Ryder broke the long silence with a hard, cold voice. &#34;How old is she?&#34;Lucie pulled herself together. She stiffened her spine, drew back her shoulders, aiming for a bravado she didn&#39;t feel. &#34;Five.&#34;Chloe poked her head around the side of Lucie&#39;s hip. &#34;I&#39;m s&#39;more months more&#39;n that.&#34;Ryder&#39;s jaw tightened and his Adam&#39;s apple jerked as he swallowed. &#34;And yourmother&#39;sname is Lucie?&#34;The floppy hat bobbed as Chloe nodded three times.Lucie hated the emotional currents eddying around her, the sadness, the anger, the heartache.Time to get a grip.Who cared if her heart beat harder than an orchestra&#39;s gong or whether she could barely squeeze air into or out from her lungs? She wasn&#39;t so much a coward as to let her daughter speak for her. Not now, not to him, not about this.She met Ryder&#39;s gaze full-on. &#34;My name is Lucinda Marie Adams. I go by Lucie rather than Cindy. I always have.&#34;A muscle in his granite jaw twitched again. &#34;Not always.&#34;Her heart threatened to fail, and her cheeks burned. No, she hadn&#39;t called herself Lucie when they&#39;d met. She&#39;d thought it so chic, so sophisticated to have no...", "title": "The Daddy Surprise (Love Inspired)", "price": 3.82, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51whgufLnPL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 3895450}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

{"asin": "0373876246", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Spring&hellip; Kent County, DelawareRuth Yoder lifted her skirt and deftly climbed the wooden stile at the back corner of the fence that marked the property line between her family's farm and their nearest neighbor. The sun-warmed boards felt good on the soles of Ruth's bare feet, bringing back sweet memories and making her smile.Dat's stile, God rest his soul.How she missed him. The world had always seemed safe when her father was alive. Without him at the head of the table, life was more uncertain.Whatwascertain was that if they didn't hurry, recess would be over, and Mam wouldn't get her lunch. &#34;Come along, Susanna,&#34; she called over her shoulder to her sister.&#34;Come along,&#34; Susanna repeated as she scampered up the stile, clutching their mother's black lunch pail tightly in one chubby hand. Susanna would be eighteen in a few months. She should have been able to carry the lunch across the field to the schoolhouse unaccompanied, but in many ways, she would always be a child.The English said Susanna had Down syndrome or called her a special-needs person, but Dat had always said that she was one of the Lord's gifts and that they should feel blessed every day that He had entrusted her to their family. Susanna's chubby face and slanting blue eyes might seem odd to strangers, but to Ruth, her dear little face, framed by the halo of frizzy red hair that marked her as one of Jonas Yoder's seven daughters, was beautiful.Susanna's whiteKapptied over her unruly bun, her Plain blue dress and white apron were exactly like those that Mam had sewn for Ruth. But Susanna's rosy cheeks, stubby little feet and hands and bubbly personality made her unlike anyone that Ruth had ever known.Sometimes, to her shame, Ruth secretly felt the tiniest bit of envy for her sister's uncomplicated world. Ruth had to struggle every day to be the kind of person her mother and her church expected. Being a good soul just seemed to come naturally to Susanna. Ever since her sister Johanna had married and moved to her husband's farm down the lane, the responsibility of being the oldest child had settled heavily on Ruth's shoulders. It was that sense of responsibility that had caused her and Mam to have words after breakfast this morning. Not an argument exactly, but a disagreement, and that conversation with her mother made her stomach as heavy as one of Aunt Martha's pecan-raisin pies.&#34;You're twenty-three out, Ruth,&#34; Mam had reminded her as she'd taken her black bonnet from the hook and tied it over herKappbefore starting off for school. &#34;You joined the church when you were nineteen. You've done a woman's job in our house since you were fifteen. It's past time you chose a husband and had your own home.&#34;&#34;But you need me here,&#34; she had insisted. &#34;Without Dat, running the farm, taking care of Susanna and teaching school is too much for you. It's better that I remain single and stay with you.&#34;&#34;Fiddle-faddle,&#34; Mam had said as she'd gathered her books.&#34;&hellip;Roofie! You're not listening to me.&#34;&#34;Ya,I am.&#34; Ruth shook off her reverie and steadied her sister as she descended the steps on the far side of the fence.&#34;But you're not. Look!&#34; Susanna pointed. Above the trees, in the direction of the school, rose a column of smoke.&#34;Samuel's probably burning brush.&#34;&#34;But, Roofie.&#34; Susanna trotted to keep up with Ruth's longer strides as they followed the narrow path through the oak grove. &#34;I smell smoke.&#34;&#34;Mmm-hmm,&#34; Ruth answered absently. Tonight she would apologize to her mother and&mdash;&#34;Fire!&#34; Susanna squealed as they entered the clearing surrounding the one-room schoolhouse. &#34;The school is on fire!&#34;Ruth's mouth gaped in astonishment. Ahead, clouds of smoke billowed from the front porch and cloakroom of the neat, white schoolhouse. In the field, behind an open shed, Ruth spotted the children engaged in a game of softball. Upwind of the building, no one had smelled the smoke yet.&#34;Sit down, Susanna,&#34; Ruth ordered. &#34;Sit here and guard Mam's lunch.&#34;&#34;But the school&mdash;&#34; her sister protested, hopping on one bare foot and then the other.&#34;Don't move until Mam or I come for you.&#34;Susanna sighed heavily but dropped to the ground.Thank You, Lord,Ruth thought. If there was one thing she could depend on, it was that Susanna would always do as she was asked, so at least she wouldn't have to worry about her safety. Closer to the school than the field, Ruth ran toward the burning structure, bare feet pounding the grass, the skirt of her dress tugging at her knees.As she drew closer, she saw Mam's new student, Irwin Beachy, crawl out from under the porch. His face and shirt were smudged black, and he was holding his hands out awkwardly, as though they'd been burned.&#34;Irwin? What happened? Are you hurt?&#34; she called to him.The boy's eyes widened in terror. Without answering, he dashed away toward the woods.&#34;Irwin!&#34; Ruth shouted. &#34;Come back!&#34;When the boy vanished in the trees, she turned back to the school. An ugly crackling noise rose and flames rippled between the floorboards of the front porch. Through the open door, she could see tongues of red flame shimmering through the black smoke. The cloakroom seemed engulfed in fire, but the thick inner door that led to the single classroom was securely closed.Wrapping her apron around her hands to protect them, Ruth grabbed the smoking rope that dangled from the cast-iron bell by the steps. She yanked hard, and the old bell pealed out the alarm. Then she released the rope and darted to the hand water pump that stood in the yard.By the shouts and cries coming from the ball field, Ruth knew that the children had heard the bell and seen the smoke. By school age, every Amish child knew what to do in case of a fire, and she was certain they would arrive in seconds. She pumped hard on the handle of the water pump, filling the bucket that always sat there, and then ran back to dash the water onto the front wall of the school. Two of the older boys pounded up behind her. Toby Troyer pulled off his shirt and beat at the flames with it. Vernon Beachy grabbed the empty bucket from Ruth's hands and raced back to refill it.Ruth's mother directed the fire-fighting efforts and instructed the older girls to take the smaller children back to where Susanna waited so that they would be out of danger.Two of the Beachy boys carried the rain barrel to the other side of the schoolhouse and splashed water against the wall. Other boys used their lunch buckets to carry water. One moment they seemed as if they were winning the battle, but the next moment, flames would shoot up in a new spot. Someone passed her a bucket of water, and Ruth rushed in to throw it on the porch roof. As long as the roof didn't catch fire, the building might be saved. Abruptly, a sensation of heat washed up over her. She glanced down to see that sparks had ignited the hem of her apron.As she reached down frantically to tear off the smoldering apron, strong hands closed around her waist and lifted her off the ground. Before she could utter a protest, Ruth found herself thrown onto the ground and roughly rolled over and over in the grass. Her bonnet came off, her hairpins came loose, and her hair tumbled down her back.&#34;Are you trying to kill yourself? Didn't you see your apron on fire?&#34; A stranger with the face of an angel lifted her into his arms, and gazed into her face.Ruth couldn't catch her breath. All she could do, for a second, was stare into the most beautiful blue eyes she had ever seen. Behind her she heard the shouts of male voices, but she couldn't tear her gaze from the eyes.&#34;Are you all right?&#34;She swallowed hard, unable to find her voice, and nodded as she began to cough.&#34;You scared me half to death,&#34; he murmured, still hold ing her against him, his body as hot against hers as the flames of the fire behind them.&#34;Is she hurt?&#34; Mam laid a hand on Ruth's arm as her rescuer backed away from the smoking building.The sound of her mother's voice brought her back to the reality of the situation. &#34;Put me down,&#34; she ordered, embarrassed now. &#34;I'm fine.&#34;&#34;Her apron was on fire. Her clothes would have gone up next,&#34; he explained, lowering Ruth gently until her bare feet touched the ground.&#34;It looks like the fire's almost out,&#34; Mam said, turning to see Roman and one of the older boys spraying the back wall with fire extinguishers. &#34;Thank goodness they were able to climb in the window and get the extinguishers.&#34;Ruth snatched off her ruined apron and accepted herKappthat Mam handed her. Flustered, she stuffed her loose hair up in the dirtyKapp,stabbing the pins she had left into the hastily gathered knot of red hair.&#34;You sure you're all right?&#34; The beautiful stranger was beside her again. He cupped a strong hand under her chin, tilted her head up and looked boldly into her face.Ruth bristled and brushed away his hand. The man staring at her was no angel and entirely too handsome for his own good. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with butter-yellow hair that tumbled over one eye and a dimple on his square chin.

{"asin": "0373876904", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Oh , man. Just his luck. Sandi Bradshaw. Keith&#39;s widow.Bryce Harding stared down at the dainty blonde with shiny, blunt&#150;cut hair, her long&#150;lashed gaze leveled on him. Dark blue eyes reflected the same dismay that slugged him in the stomach when she&#39;d turned toward him. She recovered faster than he did, though. Planting fists on her curvaceous, jeans&#150;clad hips, she gave him a wary&#150;eyed once&#150;over, taking in his T&#150;shirt, shorts and flip&#150;flops.&#34;How may I help you&#151;Sergeant?&#34;He forced cheerful warmth into his words. &#34;I didn&#39;t know you worked here, Sandi.&#34;Had he known, he&#39;d have steered clear of Dix&#39;s Woodland Warehouse tonight. He liked to patronize locally owned businesses in his mountain&#150;country hometown of Canyon Springs, Arizona. But a big&#150;box store would have fit the bill just as well.&#34;I work here part&#150;time when I&#39;m not teaching school.&#34; She folded her arms, expression still guarded. &#34;May I help you find something?&#34;&#34;I&#151;&#34; Why was he scrambling for words just like he did last winter when he approached her? He&#39;d voiced his sympathy concerning her loss. That seemed appropriate considering he and Keith had been buddies since second grade. But it had been an awkward meeting. She&#39;d pretty much looked at him as if he&#39;d sprouted antlers. Kind of how she was doing now. She&#39;d murmured ill&#150;at&#150;ease words of thanks and that was that.He&#39;d tried to convince himself at the time it was because he&#39;d caught her off&#150;guard. Maybe she hadn&#39;t heard he&#39;d gotten out of the army, had returned to town. But more likely, judging from the look on her face both then and now, her too&#150;candid husband had spilled the beans. Told her about his best friend&#39;s campaign to keep him from marrying the cute little fox he&#39;d fallen combat helmet over steel&#150;toed boots for.Sometimes, Bradshaw&#133;&#34;I&#151;&#34; He cleared his throat and scrubbed the knuckles of one hand along the jawline of his beard. &#34;I&#39;m looking for one of those patch kits. You know, that putty you fix walls with.&#34;&#34;I&#39;m afraid we don&#39;t carry anything like that.&#34; She sounded a little too pleased to share the news of a gap in the Warehouse&#39;s extensive inventory. &#34;You&#39;ll need to go to the hardware store down the street.&#34;&#34;Already did. He&#39;s out of stock.&#34;A perky eyebrow lifted. &#34;If you&#39;ve exhausted the local merchants, I&#39;d say you&#39;re in for a drive to Pinetop&#150;Lakeside&#39;s Home Depot.&#34;She tilted her head, dipped her chin slightly and looked up at him&#151;a mannerism that made his breath catch. A subtle bit of appealing body language that the way&#150;too&#150;smitten Keith had described to him in detail. More than once. Funny how he&#39;d articulated it so well it seemed almost familiar now, not the mannerism of a stranger.Pulling himself back to the conversation, he cleared his throat again. &#34;Think I&#39;ll try the discount store first.&#34;&#34;You do that.&#34;&#34;I intend to.&#34;He didn&#39;t need her approval to go to the discount store. To drive to Home Depot. To do anything. It appeared she&#39;d changed little in the nine years since she&#39;d first caught Keith&#39;s eye with that &#34;Dear Soldier&#34; letter of hers. Or since he himself had issued his buddy a disregarded warning. Keith laughed him off, but she was still a bit too pushy for his own tastes.&#34;Is there anything else you need?&#34;Obviously she wanted to get rid of him, but he wasn&#39;t going to let her shoo him out the door. Free country and all that.&#34;My grandma could use some&#133;aspirin.&#34;Though she had a medicine cabinet full of it.Sandi&#39;s resolute expression transformed to one of concern. &#34;Mae isn&#39;t feeling well?&#34;That&#39;s right, she knew his Grandma Harding. Grandma Mae he called her. &#34;Arthritis is acting up.&#34;She took an unexpected step forward, but his body blocked her and she pinned him with a pointed look. Guess she wanted him to get out of her way. After a moment&#39;s hesitation, he obediently stepped aside, the wooden floor creaking under his weight, but he caught the sweet scent of her as she maneuvered around him. Vanilla. Like Grandma Mae used in her chocolate chip cookies.She motioned for him to accompany her as she headed down a store aisle. Past the souvenir items, sweatshirts and backpacks he followed along, determined not to let the alluring sway of her hips distract him.After all, he was New Bryce now.She was Keith&#39;s wife.And not his type by a long shot.She halted in front of a shelf and bent to snag an aspirin box. Placed it in his open palm. &#34;This is what you want. Easier on the stomach, apparently.&#34;He stared down at the box, then back at her. &#34;You a nurse now or something?&#34;&#34;No, but Sharon Dixon, who owns this store, is on an aspirin regimen for her heart. I&#39;ve heard her talk about the benefits of this type.&#34; She pointed at the pain remedy. &#34;Try this one.&#34;&#34;Does it come in a larger size?&#34;She took the box from his hand, her soft, slight one brushing his own, igniting his palm with a sensitivity he didn&#39;t know it possessed. Involuntarily his hand fisted, but a moment later she pried open his fingers to fill it with a supersize variety of the same aspirin brand.&#34;Anything else Mae could use? A heating pad, maybe? I&#39;ve heard that sometimes helps.&#34;He studied the cardboard container, then looked at her again. She sounded sincere enough. Helpful. Concerned about his grandma. Maybe this was the side of her she&#39;d let Keith glimpse. Softening her&#151;how should he put it? &#151;uncompromising inclinations.&#34;I think this will do. Thanks.&#34;&#34;Very good.&#34; Her tone reverted to the impersonal, as if she&#39;d again realized to whom she&#39;d been talking&#151;chatting with the man who&#39;d done his best to save his buddy from a lifetime of regret. She headed back down the aisle. &#34;I can check you out up at the front.&#34;He followed her to the polished wooden counter and set the box down, then fished in a back pocket for his wallet. Pulled out a twenty, then broached a touchy subject. &#34;I guess the museum will be open Memorial Day?&#34;With Sandi being the president of the local historical society, he&#39;d had to call her several weeks ago. Had to notify her of upcoming changes to the agreement on the space his grandma leased to the Canyon Springs Historical Museum. It hadn&#39;t gone over well.She gave him a probing glance as she rang up his purchase. &#34;Is there a problem with the museum being open?&#34;&#34;No. Just wondering what to expect.&#34;&#34;If you hadn&#39;t moved into the apartment above it with your grandma, you wouldn&#39;t be bothered by the historical society&#39;s comings and goings.&#34;Grandma said Sandi had devoted herself to the museum since Keith&#39;s death, but who was she to judge if he should or shouldn&#39;t move in with his grandma? Grandma Mae was his first and only concern, and if her ability to remain relatively independent depended on having him close by, well so be it.&#34;Didn&#39;t say I was bothered. Just need to know what the plans are so I can keep my grandmother informed. After all, it is her home.&#34;&#34;I haven&#39;t forgotten that.&#34; Sandi&#39;s gaze sharpened as she handed him his change. His heart rate ramped up a notch, anticipating her fingers would again brush his, but she carefully placed the bills and coins into his palm without contact. &#34;But it may have slippedyourmind, Sergeant, that while you were dashing around the world on yet another tour of duty, the rest of us were right here making sure her needs were met.&#34;No, maybe he hadn&#39;t been here, but nobody else managed to keep Grandma from falling down the back stairs, either. Or keep her from breaking her ankle, a wrist and a few ribs. He counted slowly to ten, determined not to let Keith&#39;s wife push his buttons. Grandma Mae always said the unspoken words you are master of, the spoken words are master of you.Not that he&#39;d always listened.&#34;That&#39;s something I&#39;m well aware of, thank you, and for which I&#39;m grateful.&#34;&#34;Then please make an effort to remember that&#151;&#34; her words came softly enough, but he didn&#39;t miss the underlying edge &#34;&#151;the next time you think about raising the rent on the historical museum and send us scrambling to make up the difference. That&#39;s why we&#39;re keeping it open on a holiday.&#34;It was clear she thought the increase was nothing more than fun money for him. No doubt her husband had filled her in on the off&#150;duty lifestyle of Old Bryce. Probably didn&#39;t know there was a New Bryce now. He hadn&#39;t exactly announced it to the town. She didn&#39;t know, either, that his volunteer work and part&#150;time jobs were just biding time until the hiring freeze ended and that promised firefighter position opened up. Well, he wasn&#39;t going to explain his reasoning for the rent increase to her. It was nobody&#39;s business but his and Grandma Mae&#39;s.Sandi tilted her head, her expressive eyes questioning, still waiting for a response to her pointed remark. But this time that cute little mannerism didn&#39;t stir him. Much. He shifted the gear of his tone into neutral and held up the aspirin box. &#34;I&#39;ll keep your recommendation in mind. And thanks for your help.&#34;He turned away and headed to the door, conscious of her annoyed stare piercing into his back.A shame such a pretty little gal had a mile&#150;wide unyielding streak. Nobody would ever guess looking at her&#151;at the full, soft mouth, eyes the color of a twilight sky, the winsome little mannerisms.A mighty big shame.And he could see right now this museum business was going to put him in front of the firing line of her prickly disposition. Especially when she found out the museum&#39;s days were numbered.Bu...", "title": "At Home in His Heart (Love Inspired)", "price": 3.82, "salesRank": {"Books": 2693446}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PFK9tlX5L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373817185", "0373878818", "0373817525", "0373876548", "0373817509", "0373878761", "0373816103", "0373814364", "0373878540", "0373878249", "0373877706", "0373877765", "0373815751", "0373877528"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0373876548"]}}
{"asin": "0373877048", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Mei Clayton veered off the trail near the summit of Belle&#39;s Peak, found the edge of the cliff where she&#39;d often picnicked as a teenager and surveyed the panorama of rugged ranching country below.To the west, shadowed by the massive, snowy peaks of the Rocky Mountains, lay the distant, rustic cowboy town of Clayton, Colorado. Her hometown, named after a greatgrandfather she&#39;d never met. The last place she wanted to be.Especiallyfor an entire, interminable year, though that&#39;s exactly what she had to do, thanks to a stipulation in her grandpa George&#39;s will.A year&#151;but not one day more.Mei and each of her five cousins all had to comply, or none would receive a single penny. And though Mei would have preferred to continue teaching in San Francisco, she just couldn&#39;t let the others lose out on the inheritance some of them badly needed.Delaying her inevitable, awkward arrival, she&#39;d parked along the highway to hike one of the easier trails in this part of the Rockies, just to savor one of the few good memories she&#39;d kept close to her heart during her years away.Maybe she&#39;d never felt accepted by the Clayton family, but she&#39;d loved every moment that she spent hiking and climbing these rugged peaks.Yet even up here, she hadn&#39;t found a sense of solitude and peace. The snow-dusted trail offered an easy climb and breathtaking vistas, and she&#39;d already run into several other local hikers taking advantage of the bright sunshine on this first weekend of November.She&#39;d hoped to do a little climbing and had brought her gear in a backpack. But the snow was deeper at this higher elevation, and she needed to turn back. Get in her car. And face her return to the town she&#39;d so desperately wanted to leave as a teen.Though it was her impending conversation with her widowed mother that truly had her stomach tying itself in a tight knot. How would Mom react when she heard the news about her son? Lucas had been in a few scrapes when he was a teenager, but nothing like the one he was in now.At the sound of voices and the merry jingle of bear bells, she stopped at one side of the trail to let a pair of hikers pass.One of them continued on, but the girl pulled to a stop. &#34;Mei?&#34;Mei looked up in surprise at the pretty teenager standing in front of her in a puffy pink down jacket and jeans. &#34;Jasmine?&#34;Her cousin Arabella&#39;s ward tucked a long strand of silky brown hair behind her ear, her eyes sparkling. &#34;What are you doing back in Colorado so soon? We didn&#39;t expect you until Christmas.&#34;Warmed by the girl&#39;s obvious happiness, Mei felt some of her tension ease. &#34;I&#133;had a change of plans.&#34;&#34;Well, I think it&#39;s great you&#39;re here. Arabella has been looking forward to you living in town again, and now you&#39;ll be here in time for the wedding!&#34;&#34;Whose?&#34; Mei recalled her mother&#39;s last email&#151;a rare event in any case&#151;that had mentioned the latest romance involving Jasmine&#39;s foster mother, and smiled. &#34;Arabella and Dr. Turner? Already?&#34;A flash of confusion crossed the girl&#39;s face. &#34;Mine. You didn&#39;t hear about it?&#34;Yours?&#34; Mei asked faintly.Jasmine had lived with Arabella for a couple years and had graduated from high school this past spring. Maybe she was of legal age, but&#133;&#34;We&#39;re getting married on Christmas Eve.&#34; Jasmine&#39;s smile widened as her hiking partner turned back to join her. &#34;You remember Cade, right?&#34;&#34;CadeClayton?&#39;&#39;&#34;A flood of memories rushed through Mei as she stared up at the handsome young man in a denim jacket and jeans looping an arm protectively around Jasmine&#39;s shoulders.Oh, she remembered Cade, all right. Years ago, his mother had married Mei&#39;s infamous uncle Charley.Memories flooded back from the day when Mei was getting her hair trimmed at the Hair Today beauty salon and Cade&#39;s mother happened to be sitting in the next chair.Lorelei freely admitted she&#39;d picked the wrong branch of the family tree anddefinitelythe wrong man.She&#39;d claimed the only good thing that came out of her marriage was little Cade&#133;but she was sure glad that at least her older son Jack was no blood kin to the Claytons.Mei had been all ears because, at the time, she&#39;d been in the throes of a long and futile high school crush on Jack&#151;one of the more embarrassing points in her life.Even after ten years she felt a blush warm her cheeks. He&#39;d been way out of her league. She&#39;d known it from the start, but the humiliating whispers among her classmates about her foolish crush had been even more painful. Her cousin Vincent had been the worst&#151;no surprise there. His relentless taunts had felt like jabs of a knife to her heart, and she was still sure that he&#39;d been the one to start the cruel gossip in the first place.Cade had just been a little guy when Mei and Jack were in high school, and she hadn&#39;t seen him since. Now built like a football player, only his tawny hair and warm brown eyes were familiar.He gave a low, self-conscious laugh. &#34;I guess the last time you saw me I was starting grade school.&#34;Mei laughed. &#34;If that.&#34;&#34;Weren&#39;t you in high school with my brother?&#34; &#34;Um&#133;yes.&#34;When a few drops of sleet hit Jasmine&#39;s cheek, she batted them away with her fluffy white mittens. &#34;Maybe we&#39;d all better get moving. Cade and I want to make it up to the first waterfall, and then we&#39;re heading back to town.&#34;Mei eyed the slate-gray clouds crawling over the mountain peaks. &#34;Are you sure? Maybe you&#39;d better start down with me.&#34;&#34;Nah&#151;just a few minutes more.&#34; Jasmine patted the pocket of her light jacket. &#34;I want to take some pictures up there. I hear it&#39;s like a wintry fairyland, with those shimmering icicles covering the trees from the spray of the falls. It might be good as a background for the cover of our wedding programs.&#34;&#34;W-weddingprograms?&#34; Mei felt her jaw drop. So the girl was really serious about this.Jasmine&#39;s smile turned radiant. &#34;Won&#39;t it be pretty?&#34;Mei belatedly remembered to snap her mouth shut. &#34;It&#133;it certainly will.&#34;Whatwere these two thinking? And why hadn&#39;t the adults in their lives tried to steer them away from such a huge commitment right out of high school?Cade grinned, obviously reading her expression. &#34;We got the same reaction from everyone else at first, too. But we&#39;re certain, and we&#39;re ready. And we&#39;re already planning to go on to college, believe me.&#34;&#34;We have to hurry off right now,&#34; Jasmine added apologetically. &#34;But maybe you can come over to Arabella&#39;s sometime to hear all the details.&#34;&#34;I&#39;ll do that, I promise.&#34; Mei managed a weak wave as the two of them started back on the path.What they decided to do was hardly her business, after all. Neither of them were a relative of hers.And it&#39;s not like my own choices brought me happiness, either,she thought as she took a deep breath and surveyed her surroundings.Even with the darkening clouds, it was a perfect day. And how could it not be when she was surrounded by God&#39;s perfect glory in every towering mountain peak, in every call of a Pine Grosbeak and its mate from the top of the Engelmann spruce towering overhead?Quiet joy started to bubble up inside her as she made her way down the path. Adopted from China as a baby, she&#39;d always felt like an outsider in both her extended family and this small ranching community where no one else looked like her. With a stern father and a cool, distant mother, there hadn&#39;t been much warmth and connection with her immediate family, either, except with her younger brother, Lucas.But she&#39;d been gone a long time. She was grown up now; stronger and more mature. And she now realized that she was as much at fault as anyone if she hadn&#39;t been well accepted as a child. Painfully shy and withdrawn, maybe she&#39;d seemed standoffish.Perhaps this move back home wouldn&#39;t be so bad, after all. Maybe it would even bring an opportunity for her to truly connect with her mother and extended family, and finally feel accepted as one of the Claytons&#151;something she&#39;d longed for all her life.Mei was startled out of her daydream by a bloodcurdling scream that tore through the air, followed by the deafening sound of boulders crashing down a slope. The crack of trees splintering. And then a deathly silence fell.Jasmine?Mei spun on her heel, terror grabbing her by the throat as she raced in the direction of the scream and pulled to a stunned halt.A few dozen yards up the trail, a raw, gaping crater at least ten feet across had been gouged out of the edge of a cliff where there&#39;d been a trail just minutes before. Cade and Jasmine were nowhere to be seen. Had they dashed past the crumbling ground in time?She grabbed a sturdy pine branch and looked over the edge.Please, Lord, let them both be safe.&#34;Jasmine! Cade!&#34;No one answered.There was barely a haze of snow on the floor of the ravine below, and a cloud of dust still boiled upward, obliterating the view of the bottom.Wherever it was.&#34;Wow,&#34; a woman exclaimed. &#34;If we&#39;d come down the trail a few seconds earlier we would&#39;ve been caught in that landslide.&#34;Her heart hammering against her ribs, Mei tore her gaze from the bottom of the ravine and stared at the two women who had materialized on the other side of the trail.Mei closed her eyes for a brief moment and said another silent prayer. &#34;There were two hikers here a minute ago&#151;a teenage girl and her boyfriend. Did they pass you?&#34;The women exchanged glances, then shook their heads, their eyes widening with horror as they moved closer to the edge.Mei waved them back. &#34;The rest of this area could be unstable.

{"asin": "0373874952", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The disturbing letter was safely hidden in the pocket of Edith Hargrove's apron. It had arrived along with the rest of her mail in Dry Creek, Montana, early last week, but it had not seemed right to stack a letter like that with the regular mail on the sideboard in her dining room. It wasn't a bill or a reminder for an appointment or even a notice from Social Security. So she kept it close to her, as though this might in some way tell her more about the woman who'd had the astonishing nerve to send it.Edith had read the letter so many times she could almost feel the texture of the paper against her fingers even when she wasn't holding it. She kept wondering if she'd overlooked some clue.She was still thinking about it as she sat on a stool on her front porch waiting for her recently married daughter, Doris June, to cut her hair. The morning was overcast and a bit chilly. It was quiet in the small town of Dry Creek. Edith shifted on the stool and heard the faint crinkle of paper in her pocket.She couldn't tell anyone about the letter, of course. The scented envelope had been hand-addressed to Mr. Harold Hargrove, her deceased husband. At first, Edith thought it was one of those letters that had been lost in the mail for a decade. She'd heard about letters like that and, since Harold had been dead for fifteen years, it seemed like that was the only possible explanation. But this letter had been postmarked in Los Angeles just a few days before she received it.There was no return address. Edith considered giving the envelope back to the post office without opening it until she remembered the days when she could barely afford to buy a stamp. Anyone who paid to mail a letter deserved to have it read by someone, even if it was just the intended man's widow. After all these years, Edith doubted there was anything in a letter that could disquiet her anyway.She hadn't counted on unfolding that piece of scented white stationery and seeing the woman's signature at the bottom&#151;Jasmine Hunter. Edith had felt her breath stop for a moment when she first saw the name. It was causing her to stiffen up even now just remembering it.\"You're sure you're okay with this?\" Doris June asked as she wrapped an old dish towel around her mother's shoulders. The towel would keep the trimmed hairs off both of them. \"You can change your mind, you know.You've never wanted me to cut your hair in the fall before. You always say you're too busy to do it and that you'll wait until the snow flies.\"Dead leaves were scattered all over Edith's front lawn, but snow was weeks, maybe months, away.Edith forced herself to relax. \"I can't run around looking like a scarecrow just because the weather hasn't turned.\"Doris June gave her mother a startled look. \"Your hair never looks that bad.\"Edith glanced up and gave her daughter a reassuring smile. The letter had definitely put her on edge. She thought she could still smell that envelope even though it was tucked away in her apron.She hadn't recognized the scent at first. But of course it was jasmine, the strong, mysterious scent that seemed to go with a sophisticated woman in a way that Edith's simple rose water never could. She'd avoided the perfume even before she'd heard about Jasmine Hunter, the woman Harold had&#151;what could she say?&#151; slept with, succumbed to, maybe even loved some forty years ago.After the first burst of passionate confession, Harold had refused to talk about it for weeks. He said Jasmine was moving away and that was the end of that. Of course, it hadn't been the end of anything. The woman might have gone, but the pain of knowing Harold had betrayed their marriage vows was there to stay.Edith brought her mind back to the present. \"All I'm saying is my hair could look better.\"Her daughter was quietly taking the pins out of Edith's hair. The hair itself reminded her of what she'd lost. Harold had always claimed he liked her soft brown hair pulled back in the simple bun that she wore and she'd believed him&#133;until the affair. He'd given her the same compliments after it all happened, but she'd stopped hearing them. She'd been too proud to go chasing after a new hairstyle, but she knew something somewhere had been wrong or he wouldn't have turned to another woman.Edith had never met Jasmine, but she'd always pictured her as having a fancy hairdo and some kind of exotic, sultry eyeliner. Maybe she'd even had a black hat with a sweeping wide brim. Hats were fashionable back then and elegant women were pictured wearing them in glossy magazines that Edith couldn't afford to buy on her farm-wife budget.Edith had never looked good in a hat; the only ones she'd ever owned were the ones she wore for pulling weeds in her garden. She doubted Jasmine had pulled a weed in her life. She probably wore her hats to tea parties or presidential inaugurations or the Emmys on television. Following Harold's confession, Edith had pictured the other woman as being everything she herself wasn't and those pictures had grown with time until the real Jasmine Hunter couldn't possibly have been as exciting as she was in Edith's mind.At the time, Edith had searched for the perfect word to name the affair between Harold and the woman. She knew it wouldn't change anything, though she thought it might help. But she'd never found a single word big enough to contain the pain. This thing had broken her heart.It had taken her a decade to rebuild herself enough to truly forgive Harold. The nameless pain from the affair itself and her resulting insecurity had left a dark hole in their marriage. She didn't know if they would have made it through without the help of God and their elderly pastor. Harold had grown more distant from God in those years, but she'd grown closer. She'd had no choice really. She had to rely on Him for everything.\"Well, you're usually so busy,\" Doris June said as she paused in her movements. \"Your hair can always wait. You don't have time to spend hours in front of the mirror anyway.\"At first, Edith had thought that was part of the problem. She had always been able to think of a million things she should be doing instead of fussing with her appearance. Back at the time of the affair, she had been taking care of Doris June who had been little more than a toddler. That hadn't left much time for extras like hairstyling.Edith had always looked pleasant, but she knew she wasn't beautiful in the way some women were. Her jaw was too square and her green eyes too direct for conventional beauty. She had a face men trusted, not one that inspired them to write poetry. Besides, it had seemed pointless to spend hours in front of a mirror when there were so many things to do for her family and others.After Harold's affair, she had become keenly aware of the troubles in other people's lives. She knew what it was to be alone and needy. She'd started healing her own heart by helping other people.Eventually, the questions she'd been asking herself had faded away. She finally realized that Harold hadn't gone to bed with another woman because of her hairstyle or something she had said in a thoughtless moment. His decision to be unfaithful was simply that&#151;his decision. All she could do in her life was be the person God had made her to be. And, if He had made her plain and serviceable, so be it. Her decision to wholeheartedly accept herself was what gradually allowed her marriage to mend.Even now, Edith had too many things to do to worry overmuch about her hair. Like today, she should be in her kitchen boiling her Mason jars so she'd be ready when Charley Nelson finally brought over the annual bucket of chokecherries he always picked for her. She boiled the jars twice and, ordinarily, those jars would have had their first boil days ago. Charley was late with the berries and she'd just realized it this morning. She needed to make the jelly soon if she was going to be ready for the harvest dinner at church.Edith wondered if Charley knew about Harold's affair. The Nelson family had always been their closest neighbors when they were on the farm. Charley made some extra money working with the local vet so he managed to stay home on his farm that hard winter when most of the other men around had been forced to take temporary jobs in Billings to keep up with their bank payments. The roads were so bad and the distance to Billings so far that Harold had rented a motel room for several nights each week during the two months. It was then that he'd met Jasmine.Edith decided Charley couldn't have known about the affair. Harold had sworn to her he hadn't said anything to anyone except the pastor, and he'd only talked to the pastor at her request. Edith had been adamant at the time that she didn't ever want Doris June to find out about the affair. She was a sweet little girl and she adored her daddy. Today, of course, families would talk about something like that, but back then they didn't. Everyone suffered in as much silence as they could manage.\"Getting a haircut is important,\" Edith said. She had forced herself to call Doris June this morning and ask for her help. \"Women need to be well-groomed if they're going to be out and about with people.\"Doris June finished taking the pins out of her mother's hair. \"I'm always happy to cut your hair for you.\"Hair framed Edith's face. It was coarse instead of soft after all the years and much more gray than brown. \"I thought this time I'd have you do it shorter. Something over the ears.\"Edith had been too stubborn to change her hairstyle for Harold, but she felt a need to update it for this other woman. Jasmine Hunter was coming to Montana and wanted to meet and talk.

{"asin": "0373877781", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Kent County, Delaware&#133; OctoberThe storm beat against the windows of the house and rattled the glass panes. Since the early hours of morning, the nor&#39;easter had hovered over the state, bringing high gusts of wind that ripped loose shingles on the outbuildings, sent leaves and branches whirling from the big shade trees and dumped torrents of rain over the Yoder farm. It was almost 10:00 p.m., nearly an hour past Hannah&#39;s usual bedtime, but she&#39;d lingered in the kitchen, reading from her Bible and listening to Aunt Jezzy sing old German hymns while she knitted by lamplight.Neither Irwin, Hannah&#39;s foster son, nor her two youngest daughters, Susanna and Rebecca, had retired for the night. The young people seemed content to remain in the kitchen, warm and snug, sipping hot cocoa, eating buttered popcorn and playing Dutch Blitz.Today had been a visiting Sunday, rather than a day of worship, and so it had been a relaxing day. Usually, on visiting Sundays, Hannah&#39;s household would have company over or share the midday meal with one of her married daughters or friends. But the nor&#39;easter had kept everyone home. Simply getting to the barn and chicken house to care for the livestock and poultry had been a struggle.Footsteps in the hall signaled Johanna&#39;s return to the kitchen. Hannah&#39;s oldest daughter had taken her two children up to bed earlier and stayed with them, reading aloud and hearing their evening prayers, until they dropped off to sleep. Katie, two, had adjusted easily to the move to her grandmother&#39;s house, but Jonah, now five, was still difficult to get in bed, and once there, he was prone to nightmares. Since Johanna and the children had returned to live with Hannah, almost a year and a half ago, the boy often woke the entire house in the middle of the night screaming, and nothing would satisfy him but his mother&#39;s arms around him.&#34;Did you get them down all right?&#34; Hannah asked as Johanna appeared. Hannah thought her daughter looked tired tonight. The strain of her husband&#39;s illness and suicide and the need to return to her mother&#39;s home had been hard on her; now she was learning the struggles of being a single mother. Even with the support of her family and friends, it was a difficult time in Johanna&#39;s life. Hannah knew that Johanna worried about her son, and prayed that God would ease Johanna&#39;s mind.&#34;Katie was fine, but there&#39;s a loose shutter on the bedroom window, and Jonah was afraid that a monster was trying to get in.&#34;Hannah glanced at Irwin suspiciously. Even though he was almost fifteen, he still behaved young for his age, probably as a result of his parents&#39; death and his being shuffled around. &#34;Have you been telling him stories about trolls again?&#34;Irwin&#39;s face reddened and he feigned innocence. &#34;Trolls? Me?&#34;&#34;Under the corncrib,&#34; Susanna supplied, looking up from her cards. She nodded firmly. &#34;Fa. You said there was trolls with scabby knees, fleas in their ears and buck teeth.&#34;&#34;Did not,&#34; Irwin protested. &#34;Moles. I might have said there was moles under the corncrib.&#34;&#34;Weremoles,&#34; Hannah corrected.Johanna frowned. &#34;Find someone your own age to tease.&#34;&#34;But I didn&#39;t,&#34; Irwin insisted, hunching his shoulders. &#34;Must have been one of Samuel&#39;s twins who told Jonah that.&#34;&#34;We&#39;ll discuss it tomorrow. With Jonah,&#34; Hannah said, marking her place inJohnwith a red ribbon. She closed the big Bible. &#34;Past time you were in bed, anyway. You&#39;ll have to leave early to get to school in time to start a fire in the woodstove. After all this rain, the schoolhouse will be damp.&#34;&#34;Maybe the storm will get worse,&#34; Irwin suggested. &#34;Maybe there will be so much rain the school will wash away.&#34;&#34;I doubt that,&#34; Johanna said. &#34;It&#39;s built on high ground, with a brick foundation.&#34;Reluctantly, Irwin stood up, unfolding his long, gangly legs. He&#39;d grown so much in the past three months that the trousers Hannah had sewn for him in June were already high waters, short even for an Amish teenager. She&#39;d have to see about new clothes for him. Irwin was shooting up faster than a jimson weed.She&#39;d never regretted taking him in after his parents died in that terrible fire, but an Amish teacher&#39;s salary went only so far. Like everyone else, she had to watch her pennies, especially now that Johanna and the children had come back home to live. Not that Johanna was a burden; she contributed as much as she could. She had her sheep, her turkeys and her quilting, as well as the sale of honey from her beehives.Johanna picked up the empty popcorn bowl and Ir-win&#39;s mug. &#34;I think I&#39;ll turn in now, Mam. I have to finish that quilt for that English lady tomorrow.&#34;&#34;You think you can?&#34; Aunt Jezzy asked. &#34;If it&#39;s still raining, Jonah will be stuck inside again all day, and&#151;&#34;&#34;I know,&#34; Johanna agreed. &#34;He has so much energy, he&#39;ll be a handful.&#34;&#34;I can take him with me to Anna&#39;s,&#34; Rebecca offered. &#34;He can play with Mae. The two of them are less trouble when they&#39;re together.&#34;&#34;Would you?&#34; Johanna said. &#34;That would be so much help. Katie follows Susanna around like a little shadow, and if you take Jonah for the day, I know I can finish those last few squares and press the quilt in no time. The lady&#39;s coming for it Tuesday afternoon.&#34;Irwin went to the kitchen door. &#34;Come on, Jeremiah,&#34; he called to his terrier. &#34;Last chance to go out tonight. You, too, Flora.&#34; The sheepdog rose off her bed near the pantry and slowly padded after Jeremiah.Abruptly, a blast of wind caught the screen door and nearly yanked it from Irwin&#39;s grasp. He grabbed it with both hands, stepped out onto the porch and then immediately retreated back into the kitchen, tracking rain on the clean floor. Irwin&#39;s mouth gaped and he pointed. &#34;There&#39;s somethin&#39;&#133;somebody&#133;Hannah! Come quick!&#34;Jeremiah&#39;s hackles went up, and both dogs began to bark from the doorway.&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you, boy?&#34; Johanna said. &#34;Don&#39;t leave the door open. You&#39;re believing your own tall tales. Who would be out there on a night like this?&#34;Hannah tightened her head scarf and hurried to the door as Susanna, now on her feet, let out a gasp and ducked behind Rebecca.&#34;I don&#39;t see&#151;&#34; Hannah began, and then she stopped short. &#34;Thereissomeone.&#34; She stepped through the open doorway onto the porch.Standing out on the porch steps was a woman. Hannah sheltered her eyes from the driving rain and raised her voice to be heard above the storm. &#34;Can I help you?&#34; she called, shivering. She couldn&#39;t see any vehicles in the yard, but it was so dark that she couldn&#39;t be sure there wasn&#39;t one.&#34;Who is it, Mam?&#34; Johanna came out on the porch behind her.&#34;An English woman,&#34; Hannah said. She motioned to the stranger. &#34;Don&#39;t stand there. Come in.&#34;Johanna put a restraining hand on her arm. &#34;Do you think it&#39;s safe?&#34; she asked in German. Then, in English, she said, &#34;Are you alone?&#34;The girl shook her head. &#34;I&#133;I have my son with me.&#34; She turned her head and looked behind her.Standing on the lower step was one very small, very wet child. Instantly, Hannah&#39;s caution receded, and all she could think of was getting the two of them out of the rain, dried off and warmed up. &#34;Come in this moment, both of you,&#34; she said. She stood aside, grasping the door, and motioned the English people into the house. Seconds later, they were all standing in the middle of the kitchen, dripping streams of water off their clothing and faces. The young woman was carrying an old guitar case and a stained duffel bag.For a long moment, there was silence as the Amish and the English strangers stared at each other amid the still-barking dogs. &#34;Hush,&#34; Hannah ordered. Flora immediately obeyed, but Jeremiah circled behind Irwin and kept yipping. Hannah clapped her hands. &#34;I said,be still.&#34;This time, the terrier gave a whine and retreated under the table where he continued to utter small growls. And then Susanna broke the awkwardness by grabbing a big towel off the clothesline over the wood-stove and wrapping it around the small boy.&#34;He&#39;s wet,&#34; Susanna said. &#34;And cold. His teeth are chattering.&#34;&#34;Ya,I&#39;m afraid he is cold,&#34; Hannah agreed. &#34;Please,&#34; she said to the young woman. &#34;You&#39;re drenched. Get out of that sweater.&#34;The stranger, her face as pale as skim milk, set down her things and stripped off a torn gray sweater. In the lamplight, Hannah could see that she wasn&#39;t as young as she had first thought. Mid-to-late twenties probably. Her cheeks were hollow and dark shadows smudged the area beneath her tired blue eyes. She was small and thin, the crown of her head barely coming to Johanna&#39;s shoulder. But her face in no way prepared them for the very odd way she was dressed.The woman wore a navy blue polyester skirt that came down to the tops of her muddy sneakers, a white, long-sleeve blouse, a flowered blue-and-red apron and a man&#39;s white handkerchief tied like a head scarf over her thin red braids. The buttons had been cut off her shirt, and the garment was pinned together with what appeared to be safety pins, fastened on the inside.No wonder Irwin and Hannah&#39;s girls were gaping at the Englisher. For an instant, Hannah wondered if this was some sort of joke, butne,she decided, this poor woman wasn&#39;t trying to poke fun at the Amish. Maybe she was what the English called ahippie.Whatever she was, Hannah felt sorry for her. The expression in her eyes was both frightened and confused, but more than that, she appeared to expect Hannah to be angry with her&#151;perhaps even throw the two of them back out into the stor...", "title": "Redeeming Grace (Love Inspired)", "price": 3.82, "salesRank": {"Books": 1044483}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510DzA-5cnL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373877412", "0373878125", "0373876998", "0373878486", "0373876246", "0373876688", "0373877811", "0373878893", "0373877579", "0373816960", "0373875835", "0373814917", "0373817347", "0373817568", "0373876793", "0373829361", "1620291460", "1616260858", "0373877099", "1620291444", "1620291479", "1620291436", "1401688705", "0062242563", "0373877765", "1620291452", "0307729982", "1616260866", "0373445563", "061568940X", "0307730042", "0425253759", "0425253562", "0307730069", "1420121715", "0062204475", "0373878257", "0373876378", "0736926267", "0764212540", "0373879024", "0373816561", "0373828888", "0425253295", "0615721745", "0764209795", "0615702686", "0373828683", "0310335817", "1420121707", "1603745068", "0062204521", "037387779X", "0800719891", "0373878842", "0062204467", "B00B2RYVPA", "0615802931", "1595548726", "1478313781", "0764209787", "0373777868", "0764209809", "1401685943", "0307730026", "1609367707", "0062204408", "037387782X", "1420121693", "0736957340", "0764211986", "0062204440", "0615809529", "0310335124", "0764212451", "061583891X", "0800720938", "0373877757", "0736957367", "0373777353", "1420131885", "0310319986", "0615654134", "0778314723", "1426714343", "0310330459", "1401685676", "B00B1KKO36", "0800720946", "030773000X", "1595547770", "1479132438", "1426733895", "1420133071", "0736938672", "0736938621", "0062204424", "0736938680"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0373878486", "037381691X", "0373876998", "0373876246"]}}

{"asin": "0373877315", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Th e last time she saw Rob McGuire, he was down on one knee in front of all their friends, diamond ring in hand, and gazing up in hopeful expectation&#151;at her college roommate.So what on earth was he doing seven years later on her parents&#39; doorstep? And with a cop no less.With a quick intake of breath, Olivia Diaz stared from one man to the other, finding Rob&#39;s frowning demeanor more encouraging than that of the solemn-eyed officer of the law. But she focused on the latter.&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Had something happened to her parents? She&#39;d arrived in Canyon Springs shortly after midnight&#151; Tuesday before Labor Day weekend&#151;to an empty house. And now at 7:00 a.m., she&#39;d thought it still too early to call any of her sisters to find out where their folks might be.&#34;And you are&#151;?&#34; The stocky Native American officer presented a polite smile, a light breeze ruffling his hair.&#34;Olivia Diaz.&#34; She motioned to the rugged, ponderosa-pine-studded acreage encompassing the rental cabin property her family had run for decades in the high country of Arizona. &#34;My parents&#151;Paul and Rosa Diaz&#151;own Singing Rock.&#34;She shot an anxious glance at Rob, then stepped out the door and onto the front porch of the two-story log home. ItwasRob, wasn&#39;t it? She&#39;d only gotten a few hours of sleep, but surely she wasn&#39;t hallucinating. The same trim build, broad shoulders and square jaw. Something in the expressive gray eyes flickered. Did he remember her?The officer held out identification, again drawing her attention. &#34;I&#39;m Deputy Nate Karel of the County Sheriff&#39;s Department, here to see Mr. or Mrs. Diaz. Mr. McGuire here indicated they were out of town, but when we saw signs of habitation at the house, we thought they might have returned.&#34;Tension drained. Her parents were okay.&#34;No, they&#39;re not at home, but in their absence you can speak with me.&#34; They&#39;d probably gone on an overnight trip to the Valley of the Sun&#151;the Phoenix area&#151;but she herself would be managing the property in the not-too-distant future. That was her parents&#39; hope, anyway&#151;or had been. After last year&#39;s episode it might take some convincing, but she was determined to win them over.&#34;There&#39;s been vandalism to the property.&#34; The soft, Navajo cadence of the officer&#39;s tone thrummed gently in her ears as he produced a small notebook and pen.She glanced again at Rob, who seemed to be following the conversation with almost proprietary interest.What was he doing here?&#34;And you arrived when, Ms. Diaz?&#34;Refocusing on the officer, she cringed inwardly, belatedly self-conscious of her bare feet, cut-off shorts and battered Phoenix Suns tank top. Appropriate late-August attire for hanging around the house, but not for hosting a visit from law enforcement&#151;or the man who&#39;d populated her dreams for more years than she cared to admit.&#34;I got in not long after midnight. Drove all the way from Mississippi to surprise my folks.&#34;Some surprise. No one home. Nothing edible in the fridge.Not even their aging pooch, Maverick, had been around to offer a tail wag.The officer nodded, seeming to weigh her response as he jotted down a few words. &#34;Did you hear or see anything out of the ordinary at that hour?&#34;&#34;Such as?&#34;&#34;Vehicles. Voices. Lights.&#34; Amazingly, Rob&#39;s mellow tone still sounded familiar to her ears despite the passage of time. &#34;Someone broke into one of the cabins and trashed it.&#34;Great. He appeared out of nowhere in the middle of her world and this was the welcome he got. &#34;Your cabin?&#34;Rob shook his head. &#34;A vacant one. Timberline.&#34;Then what business was this of his?&#34;Ms. Diaz?&#34; The deputy drew her attention again. &#34;Would you like to take a look at it? Tell us if anything is missing?&#34;Like she&#39;d know? She hadn&#39;t been out to Timberline in almost a year. To any of the cabins on the property for that matter. Her most vivid memory of the farthest cabin to the west wasn&#39;t of its furniture and fixtures, but of a heated argument she&#39;d had there with her oldest sister, Paulette.&#34;I wouldn&#39;t be much help. I&#39;ve been out of town for quite a while.&#34; Besides, much to her shame, now that she knew her folks had come to no harm, her mind wasn&#39;t on the issue at hand. Exhilaration bubbled below the surface as she again caught the eye of her old college crush, dressed this morning in a navy blue T-shirt, jeans and charcoal windbreaker. Her heart sped up a notch as he returned her openly curious gaze. He&#39;d always been an eye-catcher, but who&#39;d have thought that was a mere fledgling phase?&#34;Okay, then,&#34; the deputy concluded. &#34;I guess that finishes things up here. I&#39;ll file the report, Mr. McGuire. Ms. Diaz. Thank you both for your time.&#34;He shook hands with Rob, nodded at her, then headed down the steps and toward an official-looking SUV parked in the pine-rimmed clearing.&#34;Wait.&#34; She moved to the edge of the porch, wrapping an arm around one of the thick, hand-hewn wooden posts. If she was to be Singing Rock&#39;s manager, she&#39;d better start acting the part. &#34;Do you have any leads? Evidence? Anything forensic to identify the culprits?&#34;Officer Karel turned. &#34;No, miss, nothing to speak of.&#34;&#34;You&#39;ll keep me posted if something comes up?&#34;&#34;I will. Good day to you both.&#34;She remained standing on the broad wooden porch of the house, watching the officer climb into his county vehicle. An approaching older model minivan passed him on his way out before pulling up in front of another two-story log structure across the clearing&#151;the lodge, hub of Singing Rock activity housing the office, recreation room and an apartment upstairs. Olivia&#39;s nose curled at the odor of the vehicle&#39;s exhaust, entirely out of place in the pristine, pine-scented retreat. Guests must be returning from an early breakfast or errand run to town.She turned again to the man standing a few feet away, keeping her arm looped around the post for fear she might float off in euphoria. Drinking in the sight of him, she couldn&#39;t disguise the delight in her voice.&#34;Rob McGuire, of all people. I can&#39;t believe after all this time you&#39;ve shown up in Canyon Springs. Welcome to Singing Rock.&#34;&#34;Thanks.&#34; He brushed an unruly lock of sun-streaked brown hair from his forehead and offered a faint, though not unfriendly smile. But from the puzzlement reflected in his eyes, it was apparent that while he&#39;d heard her name he still hadn&#39;t placed her.&#34;Remember me? Northern Arizona University? Church volleyball team? Friday night Bible study?&#34;He frowned, uncertainty still evident as he searched her features.&#34;The sole girl to jump off that bridge during the spring break mission trip to Mexico?&#34; Surely he&#39;d remember that. &#34;The one who came as a smiley face to the church&#39;s autumn college kick-off party?&#34;It was at the costume party where they&#39;d first met and she certainly hadn&#39;t forgottenhim.A debonair masked Zorro. She still remembered his first words to her.Well, now, aren&#39;t you enough to make a man smile.Was that romantic or what?His eyes widened ever so slightly. &#34;It&#39;s coming to me now. You dressed all in black and painted your face bright yellow with big black eyes and an ear-to-ear grin.&#34;&#34;Bingo!&#34;Ha ha.She&#39;d been stuck the entire evening in that perpetual state long after the other partygoers&#151;including Rob&#151;disposed of removable masks. But freshmen are entitled to a few missteps.&#34;Well, what do you know? Good to see you again.&#34;Was it?He continued to study her as if sifting through a box of memories, comparing then and now. &#34;You&#39;ll have to forgive me&#151;I thought you looked vaguely familiar when you came to the door, but I sure didn&#39;t recognize you.&#34;Thank goodness.Vanity hoped she&#39;d changed since her freshman days of tomboyishly cropped curls, skinny bod and multi-pierced ears. Late bloomer. She proudly shook back her now-cascading black locks, her smile widening in hopes she could coax one from him.&#34;I still can&#39;t believe this. What a small world. I mean, I haven&#39;t seen you since&#151;since&#151;&#34;Their gazes collided at the mutual memory, and from the discomfiture in his eyes she knew he&#39;d remembered her at last. Warmth crept into her cheeks.Oh, good going, Olivia.The last thing she wanted to do was remind him of that public turndown of a marriage proposal she and half the church witnessed. Standing but a few feet from the ring&#39;s intended recipient, she&#39;d had a front-row seat to his humiliation. &#34;So what brings you here as a guest at Singing Rock?&#34;With his hands jammed in his jacket pockets, she couldn&#39;t get an answer to the question she most wanted to know. Then again, seven years had passed so of course he was married. Guys like him always were. And likely to a woman far more beautiful and spiritual than she&#39;d ever hope to be.Just her luck, he was probably here with the little wifey and a carload of kids. Or on his honeymoon.&#34;Actually&#133;I&#39;m the manager here.&#34;Her smile faltered. &#34;Here? At Singing Rock?&#34;He nodded. &#34;Have been for a couple of weeks now.&#34;She gave an uncertain laugh. No way. As achievementoriented as Rob had been in college, he had to be heading up his own Fortune 500 company by now.

{"asin": "0373877706", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "&#34;My daddy was a policeman, too. A bad guy killed him.&#34;Grayson Wallace stared at the boy gazing up at him. The little chin jutted in evident pride, but the dark brown eyes searched his own for understanding. A connection. Acknowledgment. He was only a first-grader, not too much older than the son of Gray&#39;s former girlfriend. Way too young to have lost his daddy, let alone lost him to a bad guy.Gray massaged the shoulder of his own left arm, which was held close to his body in a sling. Hadn&#39;t the division captain said, when asking for a volunteer, that visiting a Fort Worth elementary school&#39;s career day was cushy duty? He could still hear the good-natured hoots and catcalls of his fellow officers when he&#39;d raised his hand. Couldn&#39;t blame them. He didn&#39;t have kids of his own. Spent almost every waking moment trying to keep lowlifes off the streets. He wasn&#39;t known for coaching T-ball, catching Disney matinees or reading bedtime stories in his spare time like many of the other guys and gals did.But then, they weren&#39;t aware of how close he&#39;d let himself get to Jenna&#39;s boy.No, catering to kids might not be his gift, but hanging out with grade-schoolers for a few hours was better than another day sitting around the office shuffling paperwork as he&#39;d done the past several weeks. This was a perfect task for a cop on limited duty, recovering from a shoulder injury sustained during an undercover assignment.But now, looking into this child&#39;s pain-filled eyes, it sure didn&#39;t strike him ascushy.Grayson crouched in front of the dark-haired boy, aware of other kids crowding close, and uttered the words he instinctively knew the youngster needed to hear. &#34;It takes a lot of courage to be the son of a lawenforcement officer.&#34;The boy blinked back tears and nodded, his eyes reflecting gratitude that Grayson had taken notice of him.Poor kid.&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;&#34;Cory Lopez, sir.&#34;Sir. Didn&#39;t hear that a lot these days, even in the South. Gray held out his hand and clasped the small one offered. Gave it a man-to-man shake. &#34;Good to meet you, Cory. Like your teacher said earlier, I&#39;m Officer Grayson Wallace.&#34;The first-grader took a deep breath. &#34;My dad is Duke Lopez. Did you know him?&#34;Cory&#39;s gaze held steady in confident expectation.Duke Lopez. Gray remembered the name, although he&#39;d never met him. Lopez hadn&#39;t been one of Fort Worth&#39;s finest, but on a force in one of the outlying communities. Nevertheless, any time a cop went down in the line of duty, you knew about it. It impacted you. You never forgot.&#34;No, I didn&#39;t know him, Cory.&#34; The hope in the boy&#39;s eyes dimmed, and Gray almost regretted admitting the truth. &#34;But he was a brave man. I heard how he saved his partner.&#34;The boy took a step closer. &#34;He was a hero.&#34;&#34;Yes, he was.&#34;&#34;When I grow up, I&#39;m going to be a policeman hero, too.&#34; Gray flinched inwardly. His mother must love that. &#34;That&#39;s a fine thing to aspire to, Cory.&#34;&#34;I&#39;m going to be a firefighter,&#34; a dainty African-American girl piped up, easing shyly closer to Gray. Like Cory, her outfit conformed to one of the acceptable variations of the Fort Worth Independent School District&#39;s K-8 dress code&#151;a collared navy shirt and khaki pants. The regulations helped keep kids from all walks of life on more even footing starting out and served to discourage gang affiliation and too-provocative clothing.&#34;A firefighter is a fine thing to be, too.&#34;The girl beamed and nudged a classmate.&#34;Did a bad guy hurt you, mister?&#34; A blond boy pointed at Gray&#39;s sling. Did he dare admit to kids this young that there were not-so-nice people in the world? Then again, in this neighborhood, that was nothing they didn&#39;t already know.And Cory knew it for sure.&#34;Okay, children.&#34; Miss Gilbert clapped her hands to get the attention of the first-graders, her cheerful voice raised over the childish chatter. &#34;Time to clean up.&#34;Gray glanced at the clock. He&#39;d already been at the school several hours, rotating through the elementary classroom along with a fireman, doctor, veterinarian and a marine like his little brother Carter. Each told about what they did and answered eager&#151;and sometimes amusing&#151;questions. But it was now two forty-five on a Friday afternoon. He needed to get going. He had to report back at Division, then pack a few things and head out for a five-hour drive to a western Texas community called Grasslands.While he&#39;d gone there for the first time only last weekend, he&#39;d delayed that particular trip for weeks. With his injuries to be attended to and post-assignment paperwork and court appearances filling in time until the end of September, he&#39;d had a legitimate excuse for staying away. But truth be known, he&#39;d needed time to digest his little sister Maddie&#39;s news&#151;that while he&#39;d been away on the undercover assignment, she&#39;d discovered they had family they hadn&#39;t known existed.She had a twin sister, Violet, and he an identical twin brother. He still wouldn&#39;t believe it if he hadn&#39;t come face-to-face with Jack Colby only a handful of days ago in a Grasslands church parking lot. The revelation that Sharla Wallace, the only mother he&#39;d ever known, wasn&#39;t his and Maddie&#39;s birth mother compounded the shock. And he still hadn&#39;t gotten his head around the fact that a woman named Belle Colby&#151;Jack and Violet&#39;s mother&#151;was his and Mad-die&#39;s biological mother, as well.But Belle was in a coma sustained from injuries when she&#39;d fallen from a horse last summer. Which is why he&#39;d agreed to return to the Colby Ranch this first weekend in October. There were things he and his newfound siblings needed to work through together, decisions to be made. This next trip wasn&#39;t one he looked forward to any more than he had the first one.&#34;Children! I said it&#39;s time to clean up.&#34;Gray stood, and the kids eagerly scattered to their workstations. All except Cory, who continued to gaze at him with what could only be described as a reverential look. Not good. Gray motioned to the other kids. &#34;I think you&#39;re supposed to get your stuff and catch a bus home or something.&#34;&#34;My mom picks me up.&#34;&#34;Then you&#39;ll want to be ready when she gets here.&#34;&#34;She&#39;s always late.&#34;They stared at each other in silence. What did the kid want from him? He&#39;d already told him he didn&#39;t know his father, but he could feel the boy&#39;s pain. His longing. While he hadn&#39;t been an orphan himself, he knew what it was like to grow up without a mom. His mother&#151;or at least the woman he had thought was his mother&#151;had died in a car accident when he was not much older than Cory, so he knew the loss of a parent he&#39;d loved.He knew, too, what it was like to miss his dad. He had no idea where his missionary-doctor father might be. Gray had returned from last month&#39;s close-call, determined to strengthen his relationship with his dad. But Brian Wallace had been reported as ill somewhere along the Texas-Mexico border and all efforts to trace him during recent weeks had been unsuccessful. No, Gray&#39;s situation wasn&#39;t exactly like Cory&#39;s, but it nevertheless tugged at his heart. &#34;Can I touch your badge?&#34;Jerked back to the present, Gray couldn&#39;t help but smile at the innocent request. What would it hurt? He squatted again and the boy tentatively reached out a finger to the panther crouched atop the shield. Symbol of Panther City, a nickname for Fort Worth since the late 1800s.&#34;He looks mean,&#34; Cory whispered, stroking the big cat almost as if he could feel the animal&#39;s thick, muscled coat under his fingertip.&#34;He does, doesn&#39;t he?&#34;&#34;Like he could eat bad guys.&#34;Gray drew a sharp breath. It had been two years since Duke Lopez had taken a bullet while drawing a gunman&#39;s attention from his fallen partner. Cory would have been, what? Four? How well did he remember his father?&#34;Cory, your mom is here,&#34; Miss Gilbert called from the doorway. &#34;I see her coming down the hall.&#34;Good. The little guy&#39;s mother wasn&#39;t late after all.The boy&#39;s eyes reflected evident surprise at her on-time arrival, then he gave the panther a final pat. Their gazes met in solemn recognition of a mutual bond that caught Gray off guard.&#34;It&#39;s an honor to meet the son of Duke Lopez.&#34;The boy nodded, then in a flash scampered to his workstation to clean up and gather his things. Gray rose and turned, preparing to give the boy&#39;s mother a courteous nod. But his smile froze.Whoa.That was the kid&#39;s mother? Since when did moms look like that?Even in profile as she stood chatting in the doorway with Miss Gilbert, she was a beauty. Dark flashing eyes. Dazzling smile. A warm, flawlessly creamy Hispanic skin tone. Shiny black hair pulled into a demure bun contrasted with the spiky heels, short skirt and a molded-to-her-figure blazer.Cory hoisted his backpack over his shoulder and raced to the door, breathlessly pointing toward Gray.&#34;Mom! A policeman! And he knows Daddy is a hero.&#34;She turned startled eyes toward him&#151;and the open, friendly expression evaporated from her striking features. Her lustrous brown eyes locked on his for a long moment before narrowing slightly. She then put a protective arm around her son&#39;s shoulders and ushered him from the room.&#34;But Mom,&#34; Cory protested for at least the tenth time since leaving the elementary school. &#34;I wanted you to meet Officer Wallace. He doesn&#39;t know Daddy, but he remembers him. He knows he saved his partner. Don&#39;t you even care?&#34;&#34;Of course I care.&#34; Elise Lopez attempted to keep her voice even, not wanting Cory to sense how upsetting his growing obsession with policemen had become for her.

{"asin": "0373877617", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "White-knuckled with anxiety, Hannah St. James pulled her car into the parking lot of the Marshall medical complex. She wasn&#39;t the kind to beg, but she would if she had to. She&#39;d never needed a job as badly as she did now, and she&#39;d do whatever it took to get one.Her mind still on losing her job at Family Affairs, a caregiving service for the elderly, she didn&#39;t even see the Mercedes until their fenders met.Hazel eyes wide, she slipped out of her old Kia just as an attractive, dark-haired man emerged from the obscenely shiny Mercedes and strode toward her. His broad shoulders were rigid and his handsome jaw set. Anger fairly oozed off of him.&#34;You drove right into me,&#34; he said in astonishment. His eyes were hidden behind sunglasses and no doubt shooting darts.He was an undeniably good-looking man. His finely chiseled features reminded her of her late husband, Steve. She guessed he was about her own age&#151;in his early thirties. She fleetingly wished that she&#39;d met him under different, more friendly, circumstances.She forced that thought to the back of her mind. &#34;I was distracted. I&#39;m sorry.&#34; She stared at the fenders of the two cars. The Mercedes had a ding, without a doubt, but the front of her little car looked as if it had been through a trash masher. &#34;I have insurance.&#34;She didn&#39;t add that it was liability insurance, which would pay for the Mercedes but not for her old clunker. Now, at least, the hail damage it had suffered would not be so noticeable. All eyes would be fixed on her fender.&#34;This car is six weeks old,&#34; the man muttered. &#34;Six weeks!&#34; He took off his glasses to reveal blue eyes with long, dark lashes.&#34;Mine is eight years,&#34; Hannah said absently as she pulled at one of her red curls. He probably had other cars he could use while his was in the shop. She&#39;d be taking the bus, if she had anywhere to go now that she was unemployed.Unemployed.She groaned inwardly. It would certainly be a mess getting to job interviews without a car.&#34;Ty, dear, is everything okay?&#34; The car&#39;s passenger-side window opened and a white-haired woman with piercing blue eyes peered out.&#34;It&#39;s okay, Gram. We&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;Hannah stared in horror at the old woman. She looked fragile. What if she&#39;d been hurt? Hannah raced to the woman&#39;s window before she could close it.&#34;I am so sorry. Are you okay? How does your neck feel?&#34; All Hannah&#39;s geriatric nursing skills flooded to the surface. &#34;Do you need to go to the hospital?&#34;&#34;Mercy no, dear. I&#39;m fine. Besides, I&#39;m here to see my doctor.&#34; The wizened woman gestured toward the medical building. &#34;He can look at me. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll say all is well. Thank you for being so concerned.&#34;&#34;Well, she did hit our car,&#34; the man pointed out tersely, less forgiving than the old woman. His blue eyes were just like his grandmother&#39;s, Hannah noted. Only he had unbelievably long, dark lashes. Very nice. Actually, more than nice. She surprised herself. It had been a long time since she&#39;d noticed much of anything about the opposite sex.&#34;But see how remorseful she is.&#34;&#34;Insurance companies don&#39;t care about remorse, Grams.&#34;Hannah dug a piece of paper and pen from her pocket and began to scribble. &#34;Here is my email address and the name of my insurance company.&#34;He took it without reading it and stuffed it in his pocket. With a sigh, he pulled a business card from the inside pocket of his jacket and handed it to Hannah.TDM Imports and Exports.&#34;My insurance agent will be in touch,&#34; she ventured.&#34;He&#39;d better be.&#34;Hannah winced. She watched him get into the car, pull forward and park in the handicapped space nearest the door. He then lovingly extracted the tiny white-haired woman from the front seat and lifted her in his arms as a nurse from the clinic appeared with a wheelchair. Gently, he placed the old woman in the chair and they moved away.&#34;Be still my heart,&#34; Hannah murmured as unexpected emotions rushed through her. It wasn&#39;t because he was good-looking, though he was, or that he was tall and athletically built, a fact revealed when he shrugged out of his winter coat as he followed his grandmother&#39;s wheelchair into the building. It wasn&#39;t because his dark brown hair was the kind of hair a woman could happily run her fingers through. What made Hannah&#39;s heart go pitty-pat was the sight of a man so concerned and gentle with an elderly woman. For a geriatric nurse like Hannah, it was a joy to see.Then the enormity of her own problems returned and her thoughts focused on more pressing issues. She&#39;d lost her job through no fault of her own. She was behind on her bills and had no money left in savings. After this accident, her car insurance would probably go up. She&#39;d have to find a way to repair her battered car. And her younger sister Trisha&#39;s tuition for summer school would be due before she knew it. The girl had been going to school year round in order to finish quickly. After today, there was no way Trisha could finish soon enough for Hannah.She got back into her car, crossed her arms over the steering wheel, rested her head on her forearms and allowed the hot tears she&#39;d been holding back to fall. Hannah allowed herself only a few moments of self-pity, however, before she wiped away her running mascara and got back out of her car. She&#39;d have to worry about this later. Right now, she had bigger fish to fry.When God closes a door He opens a window.A window will open, a window will open&#133;she told herself as she raced up the stairs to Dr. Phillip Harvey&#39;s office.An internist physician who specialized in geriatrics, Doc Harvey had been a close friend of her parents and, later, of hers. The office, with its commercial-grade brown carpeting, beige walls and wildlife prints, was familiar. Little had changed since she&#39;d worked here as a receptionist while she was in nursing school and subbed as an occasional caregiver for his aging father. He&#39;d been very supportive when her parents died and told her more than once since that if she ever needed anything, she should call him. Hannah had never taken him up on his offer until now.She took a chair in the waiting room, still panting a little from her shortcut up the stairs, and tried to calm her red curls by running her fingers through them. As she did so, the reception room door opened and the tall, attractive man from the Mercedes and the elderly woman in the wheelchair entered. The old woman fixed her eyes on each of Dr. Harvey&#39;s patients in turn, seeming to x-ray them with her clear blue gaze. This woman might be elderly, Hannah thought, but she had all her wits about her. Energy and intelligence fairly radiated from her.The older woman wore expensive clothing appropriate for this chilly March day in Denver&#151;a wool and cashmere coat, fur-lined leather boots and a silk shawl around her shoulders that probably cost as much as Hannah&#39;s entire outfit. Every hair was in place and her makeup was expertly applied. She could have been anywhere between seventy-five and ninety, Hannah thought, because although she was frail and in a wheelchair, she looked both youthful and old at once.Hannah returned her attention to the man pushing the wheelchair. When he laughed at something the receptionist said, his smile flashed white and even. She hadn&#39;t been privy to that smile in the parking lot, unfortunately. Still, the most noticeable things about him were the same remarkable blue eyes as those of his grandmother&#39;s.He scanned the room for a place to sit. The only open spot was next to Hannah.He didn&#39;t look any happier than she felt. &#34;Do you mind if my grandmother sits here? There&#39;s a spot for her wheelchair.&#34;&#34;Please do.&#34; Hannah watched him as he patiently maneuvered the wheelchair into place and tenderly helped his grandmother remove her scarf and coat. In this throwaway society, some people behaved as if the elderly were dispensable, but not this man. He was irate over his car but, given the way he handled the older woman, Hannah could forgive him for that.Settled, the old lady leaned toward Hannah, put her gnarled hand on Hannah&#39;s smooth one and whispered, &#34;Don&#39;t mind him. You know how men are about their cars. He&#39;s been cranky lately. It&#39;s something about falling behind at work and needing to spend more time at his office. The car was just the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. We&#39;ll have it fixed in no time.&#34;Hannah wasn&#39;t sure it was that simple, but she smiled gratefully at the woman. &#34;Thank you. I really am sorry.&#34;The lady waved a dismissive hand and changed the subject. &#34;This wheelchair is for the birds. I hope my broken foot heals quickly so I can get out of this thing.I drove my car until I was in my eighties, you know. Unfortunately, my doctor says I&#39;m healing more slowly than I would have when I was younger.&#34;Hannah looked toward the cast on the elderly woman&#39;s foot. &#34;How did it happen?&#34;&#34;I tripped on a Chihuahua, of all things! My friend brought her little dog with her when she came to visit. I&#39;m not accustomed to having a dog around and it got tangled in my feet.&#34; Her laughter was like chiming bells. &#34;Imagine that, ninety years old and tripped up by a dog smaller than my purse! My name is Lily, by the way.What&#39;s yours?&#34;Charmed, Hannah told Lily her first name.&#34;Oh, Hannah, you should have seen the fuss when I tripped on Wilbur! Imagine naming a dog Wilbur&#151;whatever happened to names like Spot and Rover?&#34; As Lily regaled Hannah with her dog incident, her grandson leaned back in his chair and wearily closed his eyes. He was asleep by the time his grandmother&#39;s name was called, Hannah knew, because his features had softened and the frown lines on his forehead were relaxed. He was even more striking in repose.Without looking at...", "title": "The Bachelor Boss (Love Inspired)", "price": 3.82, "salesRank": {"Books": 2227402}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5121Da2ZVPL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373816391", "0373877587", "0373877765", "0373877528", "0373877625", "0373877706", "0373877641", "0373877579", "0373816219", "0373877943", "0373877595", "0373816561", "0373815913", "037387782X", "0373816642", "0373877803", "0373815344", "0373817207", "0373816510", "0739378260", "0373878052", "0373816480", "0373878435", "0373877544", "0373877846", "0373813295", "0553393650", "0373875940", "0373877838", "0373816790", "0373877390", "0373816693", "0373877749", "0373877676", "0373877560", "0373877536", "0373816502", "0373877056", "0373817029", "0373816669", "0373816162", "037387779X", "0373877757", "037381657X", "037381626X", "0842319239", "0373878656", "0373814097", "0778313859", "0373878303", "0373877501", "0373877684", "037381464X", "0373875304", "037387765X", "037387801X", "0373876262", "0373878494", "0373876459", "0373878028", "0373877730", "0373877951", "0373445121", "0373878958", "0373814941", "0373445024", "0373816340", "0373656742", "0425246043", "0373817509", "0373877633", "0373877862", "037381447X", "037382954X", "0373675240", "0373816049", "0373443374", "0373817185", "037381707X", "0373445105", "0373445180", "0373817649", "0373829078", "0373445172", "0373444990", "0373817134", "0373829353", "037387751X", "0373786190", "037381450X", "0373445237", "0373445091", "0373817088", "0373829639", "0373877145", "0373878869", "0373675100", "0373876866", "0373816707", "0824948033"], "buy_after_viewing": ["037381657X", "0373877579", "0373877641", "0373877587"]}}

{"asin": "0373877412", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Kent County, Delaware, SpringMore than forty people, Mennonite and Amish, waited in the old Grange building for the speaker&#39;s arrival. A long table covered with photographs and maps stood at the rear of the hall, and volunteers had arranged folding chairs in two sections, one on either side of a central aisle. Leah Yoder, three of her sisters, her brother-in-law, and nine giggling and whispering Amish teenagers from Seven Poplars filled the first two rows on the left.It was rare for Old Order Amish to attend events hosted by other denominations, but tonight was an exception. Leah&#39;s older sister, Miriam, and her husband, Charley, had volunteered to chaperone the outing for their church&#39;s youth group, the Gleaners, and the bishop had given them special permission to do so. Leah, at twenty, was too old for the Gleaners, but she had been just as eager as her younger sisters, Rebecca and Susanna, to see the PowerPoint presentation and hear the Mennonite missionary share his experiences in spreading God&#39;s word outside the United States.A young man in jeans and a raincoat, carrying a briefcase and a camera, wandered in from the offices in the back, and Leah thought that he might be the speaker, but it was only a reporter from a local newspaper. She hoped that he wouldn&#39;t attempt to take photos of the audience. Having pictures taken was against Amish beliefs, and if he tried to snap their picture, Charley and Miriam might decide that it was better to leave. To Leah&#39;s relief, the man found a seat near the front and didn&#39;t even look across the aisle at them.The program had been scheduled to start at seven, but it was already twenty past the hour and Susanna was growing restless. Susanna had been born with Down syndrome, and although she was eighteen, in many ways, she would always be a child. Leah had convinced their mother to allow her to bring Susanna to the presentation this evening, so her sister was her responsibility.Susanna wasn&#39;t the only one losing patience with the long wait. Herman Beachy, who could never sit still for long, was tugging at his sister Verna&#39;s bonnet strings and, by the expression on her face, she appeared ready to give him a sharp elbow in the ribs. Amish considered themselves nonviolent, but that didn&#39;t mean brothers and sisters didn&#39;t have their spats. Leah could see that the rest of the Gleaners were keyed up as well. If the youngsters became unruly, it would reflect badly on the entire Amish community, and that would put an end to any future outings of this kind.Leah leaned forward, cleared her throat and threw Charley a meaningful look.See what&#39;s keeping him,she mouthed silently.We&#39;ll just wait,he mouthed in return.Leah rolled her eyes in exasperation. What was wrong with Charley? It had been his idea to bring the youth group, but now that they were here and things weren&#39;t going as smoothly as expected, her usually gregarious brother-in-law seemed unsure of himself. Even Miriam seemed out of her element.Leah wished she and Rebecca had come alone, as she&#39;d first planned when she&#39;d seen the notice for Daniel Brown&#39;s talk. The sisters had recently returned to Delaware after spending a year in Ohio caring for their aging grandmother and great-aunt. The Amish church inGrossmamdscommunity had been more liberal than in Seven Poplars, and she and her sister had often gone to dinners, charity auctions and programs put on by the Mennonites. There, the two denominations mingled more regularly than in Seven Poplars.Leah had never stopped to think that not all Old Order Amish were so at ease with the Mennonite community. And the same went for the Mennonites. She&#39;d certainly seen it tonight when the Amish had all taken seats on one side of the aisle and the Mennonites on the other. And now, both Charley and Miriam, of all people, seemed nervous. Well, if they wouldn&#39;t go see what was going on, she&#39;d have to.&#34;Stay here with Rebecca,&#34; she whispered to Susanna as she stood up.Smiling, Susanna nodded and clasped Rebecca&#39;s hand.Leah crossed the aisle to where a gray-haired woman stood talking anxiously to a middle-aged man. Dinah was a cheerful woman who always wore a modest dress and a white crocheted head covering. She often stopped by the Yoder farm to purchase large quantities of eggs for her church bake sales. It was Dinah who&#39;d made a special point of inviting the Seven Poplars Amish community to hear the speaker.&#34;It&#39;s an opportunity not to be missed,&#34; she&#39;d said to Leah&#39;s mother, Hannah, a few weeks ago. &#34;Daniel Brown faced down an angry Moroccan mob to rescue a homeless youth falsely accused of theft. If Daniel hadn&#39;t put his own life in danger to interfere, a tragedy could have occurred.&#34;&#34;An excellent role model for our children,&#34; Mam had agreed. She&#39;d said no more about Daniel Brown, but Leah had seen her mother deep in conversation with their bishop after church the following Sunday. Both Leah and Miriam were convinced that it was due to Mam&#39;s powers of persuasion that Bishop Atlee had agreed that the Gleaners should accept the invitation to hear the young missionary speak.But now they were here and anxious for the program to begin&#133;and there was no Daniel Brown in sight.&#34;I apologize for the delay,&#34; Dinah said as Leah approached. &#34;Daniel&#39;s on his way. He&#39;s usually very dependable, but he had some problem. Something about leaving his coat at a rest stop.&#34; Dinah chuckled. &#34;Men. But, we&#39;re so pleased that so many from your church have come out to hear Daniel, especially the young people.&#34;&#34;We didn&#39;t want them to miss hearing Daniel&#39;s story,&#34; Leah said. &#34;How often do we have a real hero in our midst?&#34;&#34;Exactly,&#34; Dinah agreed. &#34;Oh, Leah, do you know my eldest son, Raymond?&#34; When Leah nodded, Dinah went on. &#34;Raymond&#39;s been trying to reach Daniel on his cell phone to see how soon he expects to arrive, but he hasn&#39;t had any luck. We thought he&#39;d be here by now.&#34;&#34;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just the storm.&#34; Leah offered a quick smile.It was raining hard outside, and the wind was rattling the shutters. Earlier, as they&#39;d driven here from the farm, they&#39;d been caught in a sudden flurry of thunder and lightning so fierce that Leah had wondered if she should turn back, but that had passed, leaving just a steady downpour. Fortunately, there was a long, open shed with a good roof behind the Grange where they could shelter the horses and buggies.&#34;Daniel&#39;s driving up from Richmond,&#34; Dinah explained, &#34;and I understand that Virginia&#39;s had bad weather all day.&#34;The side door opened, and everyone glanced up expectantly. &#34;Evening, Daniel,&#34; Dinah said. &#34;Maude.&#34; The couple took seats on the Mennonite side in the last row, and Dinah turned back to Leah. &#34;That&#39;s DanielWarnerand his wife.&#34; She dropped her voice to a whisper. &#34;They&#39;re always late.&#34;&#34;I&#39;d hoped that was the speaker,&#34; Leah said.Dinah laughed. &#34;We seem to have a lot of Daniels in our community. It&#39;s a popular name among us. One of my sons is also a Daniel. Named after my father-in-law. My husband always teased that perhaps we should give them nicknames to keep the Daniels straight.&#34; Another gust of wind shook the windowpanes and she grimaced. &#34;If we&#39;d realized that it would be such a nasty evening, we could have postponed until tomorrow night.&#34;&#34;I see that there are pictures and other material up front.&#34; Leah pointed. &#34;I was wondering if it would be all right if the young people looked at them while we&#39;re waiting.&#34; She chuckled. &#34;You know how impatient youngsters can get. They&#39;ve been looking forward to tonight for weeks.&#34;&#34;Absolutely,&#34; Dinah said. &#34;And we have a refreshment table. There&#39;s no reason we shouldn&#39;t all enjoy lemonade and cookies while&#151;&#34;Abruptly, the heavy door at the front of the building banged open and a blast of wind blew through the hall sending photos and maps flying. Leah turned to see a tall, slim man about twenty-five years old standing in the doorway. Water dripped off his jean jacket and the bill of his ball cap, pooling on the floor. A gust tore at the door, threatening to wrench it out of his grasp, but he held it open until ten-year-old Abraham Beachy ducked into the hall.Abraham was even wetter than the man in the jean jacket and ball cap. The Amish boy&#39;s face was pale and he looked frightened. The man said something to him that Leah couldn&#39;t hear, but Abraham just shuffled his feet and stared at the floor.The newcomer looked up and cleared his throat. &#34;Could I have your attention, please!&#34; He nodded to Abraham who shook his head. &#34;Go ahead,&#34; he urged.Everyone in their chairs who hadn&#39;t turned around to look when they made their entrance, turned now.Abraham swallowed hard and a deep flush rose from his throat to tint his face. &#34;&#133;Need help,&#34; he squeaked. &#34;&#133;Joey.&#34;Charley stood up and hurried toward Abraham. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; he demanded.Abraham, an undersized lad, burst into tears.

{"asin": "0373877196", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Thud. Thud. Thud. Books hit the floor all over the fifth-grade classroom, shattering the relative quiet. Brittany Gorman gathered her survival instincts and forced herself not to react. She tightened her grip on the chalk and continued to write the math homework assignment on the chalkboard. This bratty group of kids pulled some kind of stunt every time she substituted for their regular teacher. Today Brittany was determined not to let their misbehavior bother her.Brittany wrote as slowly as she could. She didn&#39;t want to turn around and see the feigned innocence on their faces until she was sure she could face them with a stoic mask in place. There was no doubt that the instigator of this little trick was the class clown who called her &#34;Miss Carrot Top&#34; or &#34;Miss Freckle Face&#34; under his breath, just loud enough that she couldn&#39;t miss hearing his remarks. She always pretended not to notice.Finally, she set the chalk in the tray and glanced at the clock before turning to the group. Some of the students had already retrieved their books, but other books still lay on the floor. She looked at the students, making eye contact with as many of them as she could before speaking. &#34;You have twenty minutes to work on the assignment. If you have any problems, raise your hand, and I&#39;ll be glad to help you.&#34;A few snickers drifted through the air, but Brittany chose to ignore those, too. Without making mention of the book incident, she roamed up and down the aisles between the desks. She breathed a sigh of relief as further conflict faded. Despite situations like this, substitute teaching was still the best of all the bad temp jobs she had tried since she&#39;d lost her position as a financial planner. Glancing out the window at the snowy Montana landscape, she prayed that all would go well until the final bell. While she waited for that sound of freedom, she vowed to double her efforts to find a real job&#151;one that didn&#39;t involve kids.Half an hour later, Brittany fled out a side door and searched the school&#39;s parking lot for her ride. She spotted her roommate&#39;s sporty silver compact car and dashed toward it. She opened the door and hopped in.Glancing at Brittany, Heather Watson maneuvered her way to the main road, her dark eyes full of curiosity. &#34;You seem to be in a hurry to get away.&#34;Brittany leaned back on the headrest. &#34;What a day! It didn&#39;t end soon enough.&#34;&#34;Want to tell me about it?&#34;&#34;No. I don&#39;t want to relive it. I can sum it up in one word. Dreadful.&#34;&#34;That bad?&#34;&#34;Worse. I&#39;m beginning to think I&#39;m just not good with kids.&#34;&#34;Not true. The kids in the church youth group love you.&#34;&#34;Thanks for your vote of confidence.&#34; Brittany smiled halfheartedly. &#34;I guess it&#39;s just that one horrible class of fifth graders that drives me crazy.&#34;Heather nodded. &#34;Is your car ready?&#34;&#34;Yes, but I&#39;m afraid to see the repair bill.&#34; Brittany released a harsh breath. &#34;That car is falling to pieces one part at a time. It&#39;s a money pit, but without a regular job, there&#39;s no way I can buy a new one.&#34;&#34;Well, at least they could fix it.&#34;&#34;I guess I should look on the bright side.&#34; Brittany forced a smile. &#34;It&#39;s a good thing that today is your day off. Thanks for picking me up.&#34;&#34;No problem.&#34; Heather turned onto the street where the car dealership was located. &#34;Are you subbing tomorrow?&#34;&#34;Not yet, but I could get a call early in the morning. After today, I&#39;m not sure I could bring myself to say yes.&#34;&#34;Then don&#39;t. Come skiing with me.&#34;&#34;You know I can&#39;t afford to go skiing, especially now with the added expense for my car.&#34;Brittany wished Heather could understand the stress of not having a real job. The need to find steady employment constantly weighed on her mind. And now that she&#39;d broken up with Max, the one reason for staying in Billings no longer existed. She needed to widen her job search.&#34;I told you that won&#39;t be a problem. My uncle Parker pays for everything, even guests. He does this every year for our family on the Martin Luther King holiday weekend.&#34;&#34;I thought I&#39;d met all your dad&#39;s siblings. How come I&#39;ve never met your uncle?&#34;&#34;Because he&#39;s a reclusive bachelor who lives on a ranch about fifty miles from Billings. I call him my mad scientist uncle because he&#39;s always working on some kind of invention. We only see him on this ski trip and maybe out at his place on the Fourth of July. And at Christmas. Otherwise, he keeps pretty much to himself on that ranch.&#34;Brittany thought the guy sounded pretty weird, but she didn&#39;t want to say anything bad about him. &#34;I&#39;d hate to impose.&#34;Heather gave Brittany a challenging look. &#34;You won&#39;t impose. You need a change of scenery, so you can forget about the loss of your job and the breakup with your worthless boyfriend.&#34;Brittany shook her head. &#34;Going on a ski vacation isn&#39;t going to help me find a job or make me forget Max.&#34;&#34;Max is very forgettable. You shouldn&#39;t waste time thinking about him. You never know. Maybe you&#39;ll meet someone who&#39;s looking to hire a good financial planner or accountant.&#34;&#34;You are such an optimist.&#34;Brittany was beginning to question her decision to stay in Billings after she&#39;d lost her job, but she had wanted to remain there because of her relationship with Max.More than ever, she wanted to prove to her parents that she could make the right choices. She had to show them that they hadn&#39;t wasted their money on her college degree. That meant widening her search for a good financial job. From the beginning, they&#39;d wanted her to forge her own path rather than follow Max to Montana. Would going home to the Spokane area mean she&#39;d have to admit they&#39;d been right? Could she make the right decision this time?Giggles floated through the air as Parker Watson entered the kitchen of the six-bedroom, cedar-sided house he&#39;d rented for the annual family ski trip. He relished the sound of harmony coming from Rose and Jasmine, his six-year-old twin daughters, who were having breakfast at the table in the eating area off the kitchen. He stared at the cup of coffee sitting on the counter and wished that somehow a nanny for his girls would appear out of the steam rising from it&#151;like a genie from a bottle.He was working on a big project that could lead to more medical writing jobs. He was already behind schedule because he&#39;d had to take over the homeschooling duties that had been Jenny&#39;s domain. If he was going to give full attention to his work, he had to find a good caregiver now.He picked up the cup and moseyed over to the table. &#34;Are you girls finished with breakfast? The ski slopes are waiting for us.&#34;Rose took the last gulp of milk, then nodded her head, her dark braids swinging across her shoulders. &#34;I&#39;m done.&#34;&#34;Me, too.&#34; Jasmine jumped up from her chair.As Rose joined her sister, Parker patted each of them on the head. &#34;Then you need to put on your ski clothes.&#34;&#34;We will.&#34; Their voices echoed around the vaulted ceiling as they raced for the stairs.Parker cupped his hands around his mouth. &#34;Don&#39;t forget to brush your teeth.&#34;The girls stopped and leaned over the balustrade that surrounded the loft at the top of the stairs. &#34;We won&#39;t.&#34;&#34;Sounds like they&#39;re pretty excited about today.&#34; Delia chuckled.Parker turned to his housekeeper. &#34;I hope they get along. All I&#39;ve done the past couple of weeks is break up fights.&#34;&#34;You know it started right after Jenny, Mark and their kids moved away. The girls lost an important person in their lives, and it&#39;s upset their whole routine.&#34;&#34;I know, but that doesn&#39;t mean they should misbehave.&#34; Parker sighed. &#34;I wish Mark hadn&#39;t taken that job in Colorado, but I can&#39;t blame him for taking a better opportunity. It&#39;s tough losing a foreman and the girls&#39; teacher and caregiver all at once. Since I started advertising for a nanny, I&#39;ve had exactly one inquiry. And as soon as the woman found out that the position was on an isolated Montana ranch, she wasn&#39;t interested.&#34;&#34;You know what I&#39;ve said about that.&#34; Delia gave him a no-nonsense look&#151;the kind she always gave him when she was trying to make a point. &#34;Folks who live closer to the ranch won&#39;t have a problem with the location.&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t know why you think I&#39;ll find a nanny in Stockton. The people in that town have no use for me, and I have no use for them.&#34;Delia&#39;s wrinkled face brightened, and she winked. &#34;Heather might know someone. Maybe that friend she&#39;s bringing with her?&#34;&#34;You are such an optimist.&#34; Parker rubbed the back of his neck and gave Delia a wry smile before turning his attention to the noisy footsteps on the stairs. &#34;Sounds like the girls are ready. Tell Heather and her friend to head up to the slopes when they get here.&#34;Hours later, Parker stepped into the ski lodge and, as he&#39;d promised Heather minutes before, searched the room for a petite redhead. The color of her hair should make her easy to find. He wasn&#39;t looking forward to meeting Heather&#39;s friend, but he was doing this to please his favorite niece.The smell of burgers and fries wafted his way as he walked farther into the Main Lodge restaurant. Finally, he spotted an attractive young woman with bright coppery hair that fell around her shoulders. She sat alone at a table near the wall of windows looking out at the mountain.Her expression told him she was deep in thought about something that didn&#39;t make her happy. He could relate to that look.He stepped forward. &#34;Excuse me. Are you Brittany Gorman?&#34;She stared up at him, her appearance still somber. Her light brownish-green eyes held a puzzle...", "title": "Montana Match (Love Inspired)", "price": 3.82, "salesRank": {"Books": 2331370}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CgMNkQLcL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["037387720X", "0373877188", "0373815956", "0373876157", "0373817649", "0373817452", "0373877455", "0373875800", "0373877234", "0373878141", "0373877838", "0373817029", "0373877544", "0373877617", "0373877501", "0373817401", "0373816642", "0373874693", "0373877528", "0373878028", "0373878532", "0373816219", "037381626X", "0373878540", "0373817231", "0373877846", "037387782X", "0373878508", "0373878516", "0373877765", "037387801X", "0373878354", "0373878249", "0373817088", "0373817207", "0373816979", "0373878427", "0373877994", "0373877404", "0373878435", "0373877757", "0373877951", "0373877536", "0373877889", "037381707X"]}}

{"asin": "0373877803", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A dark tidal wave of fear swept through Calista Sheffield as she paused at the door of the Downtown Denver Mission. She took a deep breath and wiped damp palms on the legs of her jeans. Her image was reflected in the glass door as clearly as in a mirror, the bright Rocky Mountain sunshine as backlighting. Giving her casual outfit a quick scan, she tucked a strand of honey-blond hair behind her ear and tugged at the hem of her black cashmere sweater. She prayed no one in the shelter would be able to tell the difference between Donna Karan and a knockoff, because she wasn&#39;t here to impress anyone. She was here to volunteer.Her reflection showed a pair of large green eyes shadowed with anxiety. Calista squinted, hating her own weakness. There was no reason to be afraid when she ran a multimillion-dollar company. She gripped the handle and swung it open, striding inside before the heat escaped.The exterior of the five-story mission was a bit worse for wear, but the inside seemed clean and welcoming. In the center of the enormous lobby, a tall pine tree bowed under the weight of handmade ornaments and twinkling lights. Calista&#39;s gaze darted toward a group of men clustered near the double doors at the far end. Probably the cafeteria.Maybe she was just in time to help serve a turkey dinner with trimmings. A vision of handing a plate piled high with steaming mashed potatoes and gravy to some desperate soul passed through her mind&#39;s eye. This was going to be great.No, this was going to be more than great; the start to a whole new life. Not like the lonely existence she had right now with only her passive-aggressive Siamese cat for company. No more pretending she had somewhere to go on Thanksgiving, then suffering through everyone else&#39;s happy chatter after the holiday. It was her own fault for letting work take over her life, but that was all in the past.This Christmas would be different.Calista scanned the lobby for a secretary. The long, curving desk spanned the area between the elevator and far wall, but it was empty. An oversize wooden cross took center stage on a staggered section of ceiling that connected the lobby to the upper level. A small smile tugged at her lips, thinking of how that sight would have made her cringe just a few months ago.A young man with the mission staff uniform and close-cropped dark hair exited the double doors, papers in hand. Calista stepped forward into his path.&#34;Excuse me, I need to see Grant Monohan,&#34; she said, in the tone she reserved for secretaries and assistants. Her eyes flicked from his deep brown eyes to the ID badge pinned to his shirt to the solid pattern of colorful tattoos that covered both of his arms from biceps to wrist.He paused, frowned a little, glanced back at the empty desk.&#34;The director,&#34; Calista added, hoping she wasn&#39;t speaking the wrong language. His dark coppery skin and angular features made her think of paintings she&#39;d seen of the Mayans.&#34;Just let me drop these papers in the office and I&#39;ll tell him you&#39;re here,&#34; he said, waving the stack of papers at her. He started off again without waiting for a response and punched in a series of numbers at the keypad by the far door.The brown patterned couches were arranged in groups of three but none of them were occupied, except the very last one, near the large windows that faced the street. An older woman sat hunched in the corner, rocking and murmuring to herself. Her brown shawl slipped off one shoulder and pooled at her feet like a stain. Dark tangles framed a wrinkled, but somehow expressionless, face. Calista swallowed a sudden wave of anxiety.A door swung open to her right and a wheelchair-bound woman rolled to a stop behind the desk. Her short gray hair was spiked on top and touched with violet. She maneuvered to the middle of the desk just as the phone rang.&#34;Downtown Denver Mission, this is Lana. How may I help you?&#34; she responded in a cheerful tone.None of this should have made her feel queasy, but the combination of the rocking elderly woman, the young man&#39;s tattoos and the purple-haired handicapped woman had Calista struggling with her resolve. She wandered toward the windows and gazed out at the snowy sidewalk, taking deep breaths. Life isn&#39;t pretty, she should know that. But after ten years of clawing her way to the top of the business world, Calista had buried any memories she had of imperfection. Memories of her own rough childhood in a place where there were worse things than purple hair and tattoos.&#34;Ma&#39;am?&#34; She snapped into the present at the word spoken quietly behind her. The young man was back. &#34;The director is just finishing up but he can see you for a few minutes before his next appointment. Go ahead and have a seat.&#34;Calista nodded and smiled brightly. &#34;Thank you,&#34; she chirped, hoping she oozed positivity and enthusiasm. They wouldn&#39;t want unhappy people around here. She was sure they had enough of those already.Grant Monohan checked the balance-sheet numbers for the third time. He knew better than to get upset at the decreasing number in black and the increasing number in red. The shelter scraped by most of the year until they got to the season of giving, or the &#34;season of guilting,&#34; as Jose called it. God had provided every day of the past seventy-five years, so he wasn&#39;t going to start worrying now.A light knock at the door and Jose popped his head in. &#34;We got another one.&#34;Grant wanted to roll his eyes but he nodded instead.&#34;Actress?&#34; Aspen&#39;s popularity had been great for them, even all the way out here in Denver. The megarich had started to settle in the area a decade ago and it showed right around the holiday season. Every year, right when the store windows changed to sparkly decorations and Santas, the famous faces started appearing. Most were dragged in by agents or managers, but a few came on their own. They would spend a few days, sign some autographs and go away feeling good about themselves. He wasn&#39;t one to turn away help, especially when it came with good publicity and a donation, but it got real old, real fast. Last year they had a blonde starlet stumble in with a twenty-person entourage. Most of them were as high as she was. He cringed inside, remembering the scene that erupted as he informed them of the &#34;no alcohol, no drugs&#34; policy.&#34;Not sure. She&#39;s pretty enough but she came alone.&#34; Jose shrugged. Grant wished he would come all the way in, or open the door wider, but Jose always seemed to be in constant motion. It was all the kid could do to hold still for a few minutes.&#34;Why didn&#39;t Lana call back here?&#34;He shrugged again. &#34;The lady just came up to me and said she had to see the director.&#34;Grant frowned, wondering if it was worse to have a volunteer who demanded special treatment, or a volunteer who ignored the disabled secretary. He stood up and stretched the kinks from his back. Maybe he&#39;d look into a better chair after the crazy holiday rush was over. The ratty hand-me-down was obviously not made for a six-footer like himself. Or maybe turning thirty was the start of a long, slow slide into back trouble.&#34;Tell her I&#39;ll be right out.&#34; Jose&#39;s head disappeared from the doorway. Grant crossed the small office space and absently checked his reflection in the mirror near the door. He was looking more and more like his father every year. Women told him what a heartthrob he was, like a classic movie star. They never knew how close they were to the truth. But what he saw&#151;instead of the dark wavy hair, strong jaw and broad shoulders&#151;was the man who walked away from his mother when he was just a kid. Grant shook his head to clear it.All things are made new in You, Lord.He had a heavenly father who would never run away and he needed to remember that.Grant pushed open the heavy metal door and stepped into the lobby, letting the door close with a thud behind him. It wasn&#39;t hard to pick out the new volunteer. It wouldn&#39;t have been hard to spot her in a crowd at the Oscars, she was that pretty. She had the California party-girl look with an added healthy glow, but had wisely left the party clothes at home.At least she was dressed conservatively. If you could call cashmere and designer jeans conservative. He sighed. Rich people could be so clueless. He watched her for a few moments as she stood near the window, arms wrapped around her middle. She sure didn&#39;t have the confidence of a professional actress. Unless the whole nervous attitude was an act.She turned suddenly and looked straight into his eyes as if he had called her name across the lobby. Grant felt heat creep up his neck. He must look like a stalker, standing there silently. He strode forward, forcing a welcoming expression.&#34;Grant Monohan,&#34; he said, extending his hand. She took it, and he was surprised by the steadiness of her grip.&#34;Calista Sheffield,&#34; she answered. &#34;Wonderful to meet you.&#34; The name sounded familiar. Her smile was a bit too wide, as if she was worried about making the wrong impression. Or maybe she was turning on the star power. As if that sort of thing worked on him.&#34;Jose told me you wanted to see me. Would you like to sit down?&#34;She frowned down at the couch and said, &#34;You don&#39;t meet with anyone in your office?&#34;&#34;Actually, I don&#39;t. We have meeting rooms for groups, and we have a reception area. There&#39;s another building at the south end of the block that we use for most of our administration needs.&#34;There was a pause as she tilted her head and regarded him steadily. He could see her processing that information. &#34;Is it a shelter policy?&#34;She was quick, this one. &#34;It is. To protect the residents and myself from accusations or suspicion. We have plans drawn up for a new office that will have glass partitions but that&#39;s still a few years away.&#34; He motioned toward the long lobby desk. &#34;So, for now we have Lana get pertinent information on visitor...", "title": "Season of Joy (Love Inspired)", "price": 3.82, "salesRank": {"Books": 1189697}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pO3or8KFL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373816561", "0373877757", "0373877846", "0373877765", "037387779X", "037387782X", "0373816642", "0373877706", "0373877838", "0373877862", "0373816510", "037381657X", "0373877811", "0373829434", "0373877943", "0373878508", "0373879016", "0373817312", "0373817509", "0373816669", "037381724X", "0373878796", "0373816693", "0373445172", "0373878354", "0373878435", "0373877951", "0373877730", "0373878834", "0373878168", "0373878427", "0373816979", "0373877749", "0373878516", "0373816707", "0373817029", "0373877641", "0373877587", "0373816502", "0373816766", "0373878540", "0373877986", "0373817452", "0373878486", "0373817207", "0373816480", "0373817614", "0373878478", "0373878532", "0373877935", "037387846X", "037387880X", "0373877544", "0373877617", "0373816685", "0373445121", "0373778155", "0373817371", "0373817088", "0373877889", "0373816790", "037387796X", "0373877056", "0373878036", "0373815131", "0373817541", "0373445180", "0373445105", "0373878028", "0373877633", "0373877994", "0373817649", "0373816715", "0373829353", "0373815913", "0373816391", "0373877145", "0373878303", "0373817231", "0373878052", "0373445202", "0373816855", "0373829396", "037387832X", "0373817401", "0373815751", "0373816995", "0373816871", "0373877560", "037381514X", "037381707X", "0373817169", "0373878389", "0373878109", "0373878575", "0373816863", "0373675879", "0373445695", "0373829779", "0373878699"], "bought_together": ["0373816561", "037387779X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0373816995", "037387779X", "0373877838", "037387782X"]}}

{"asin": "0373878141", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Dear Reader,&#xA0; I live in Nevada, where the majority of the wild horses in the United States run free. Every once in awhile, I hear on the evening news that the mustangs have been struck by a car along the busy freeway, or broken down the fence in someone's front yard to feed on shrubs and grass...leaving a big mess behind. I remember my forest ranger father driving me out into the Ruby Mountains to look at the beautiful wild horses roaming his ranger district. They are&#xA0;a beautiful, wild animal. These experiences inspired me to write &quot;Healing the Forest Ranger.&quot; After losing her husband to a tragic car accident that also took her daughter's leg, the heroine is suffering from so much angst.&#xA0; And the hero has his own troubles he's trying to overcome. The wild horses are a metaphor for what the characters in this book are going through. I hope you enjoy reading this sweet book as much as I enjoyed writing it.&#xA0;:)&#xA0; Leigh Balewww LeighBale.com--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Healing the Forest Ranger (Love Inspired)", "price": 4.61, "salesRank": {"Books": 1467205}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5182jzYi6PL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0373675585", "0373817029", "0373878168", "0373816928", "037387815X", "0373878117", "0373878214", "0373816979", "0373878125", "0373816685", "0373878222", "0373878265", "0373817088", "0373817371", "0373816995", "0373878354", "0373878435", "0373878052", "0373878249", "0373816286", "037381707X", "0373816855", "0373816987", "0373829639", "0373817541", "0373816960", "0373878311", "0373878257", "037382968X", "0373877943", "0373876718", "0373878540", "0373878567", "0373878532", "0373878494", "0373878818", "037387832X", "0373878478", "0373777248", "0373816790", "0373878427", "0373675615", "037381724X", "037381688X", "0373816669", "0373445350", "037387796X", "0373878044", "0373817185", "0373816863", "0373817134", "0373878796", "0373878516", "0373817231", "037387880X", "0373878273", "0373878389", "0373817525", "0373817509", "0373817207", "0373816871", "0373878745", "0373445385", "0373878761", "0373817452", "0373878028", "0373878400", "0373778155", "0373878303", "0373878575", "0373878486", "0373878109", "0373878338", "0373816707", "0373675534", "0373878621", "0373877994", "0373817614", "0373878788", "0373879008", "0373878974", "0373877951", "0373878990", "0373817169", "0373878648", "0373878605", "0373878877", "037387782X", "0373878885", "0373877838", "0373817649", "0373879059", "0373877986", "0373878508", "0373816391", "0373829655", "0373829949", "0373878362", "0373816642", "0373445431"], "bought_together": ["0373675585"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0373189273", "037381691X", "0373816979", "0373816987"]}}

{"asin": "0373880545", "description": "Told through a clever mix of narrative, letters, e-mails and instant messages, this multigenerational tale covers all-too-familiar ground as it charts the trials of three women living under the same roof: middle-aged marriage counselor Cecelia Dupree, a depressed recent divorc&eacute;e with a penchant for sweets; her newly widowed mother, Belle; and her 17-year-old daughter, Erin, who's suffocating under CiCi's too-strict rules. Having been burned by her cheating ex, who fancies women in their 20s, CiCi can't seem to move on. Predictably, it's her vivacious mother, as well as the good-humored (and horny) seniors in Belle's reading group, who teach CiCi to embrace life&mdash;and the handsome younger man who's interested in pursuing a relationship with her. The book isn't as sweetly playful as the cover, featuring a scrumptious-looking ice cream cone, suggests, and the plot sometimes reads as if plucked from fantasyland (e.g., all three women pair off with fantastic men who love them just the way they are). But what saves this story from being a 300-page clich&eacute; is its moments of insight and poignancy. Whether writing from the perspective of an angst-ridden teenager or a bitter, depressed divorc&eacute;e, Archer (Shocking Behavior, etc.) captures the voices and vulnerabilities of her characters with precision.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0373880561", "description": "Though now best friends in California, neglected housewife Bitsey, trophy wife M.J. and divorc&eacute;e interior designer Cat are all \"Grits\": girls raised in the South. When the death of M.J.'s wealthy husband leaves her destitute on the eve of Bitsey's 30-year high school reunion, the three plan a road trip to their hometown of New Orleans&mdash;and the boyfriend each has left behind. M.J. abandons her former flame in favor of paraplegic auto mechanic Steve. Cat, meanwhile, finds that sparks still fly with sheriff Matt, and Bitsey is tempted by her ex-love Eddie, now an activist lawyer. Family dramas abound as well, from Bitsey's disaffected daughter to Cat's alcoholic clan. Events work out far more neatly than in real life (e.g., all three women breezily abandon California and move back home), but Becnel deftly captures the way actual women think, giving the book an emotional groundedness that balances its romantic fantasy; insightful descriptions of Steve's physical limitations and Bitsey's distant marriage add realism as well. Brisk and entertaining, with a welcome focus on middle-aged sexuality, this tidy tale proves that Becnel is just as much at home writing high-quality contemporary fiction as penning the historical fiction for which she's known (The Heartbreaker, etc.).(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0373888511", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Mariah Harrington wasn't worried when she got home from work and found her eight-year-old son and her roommate missing. It was a gorgeous late-summer afternoon, and odds were good that Billy and Jenny had walked to the nearby park to enjoy an hour or so of outdoor fun. Jenny's car was in the driveway, so Mariah knew they couldn't have gone far.She threw her keys on the kitchen table, stepped out of her navy high heels and opened the refrigerator to look for the can of soda that she'd hidden the night before in the vegetable bin. No chance Billy or Jenny would look in there. They both shared the same abhorrence for anything green and good for them.Smiling as she carried the cold can into the living room, she thought of her son and her roommate. It was hard to believe how much an eight-year-old and a twenty-five-year-old could have in common. But in many ways Jenny was as much child as adult.Of course, that came from being raised by an overly protective, domineering brother. Her smile fell away as she thought of Sheriff Lucas Jamison.As the mayor's secretary, she often found herself acting as a buffer between the hardheaded Lucas and the ineffectual mayor of Conja Creek. But it wasn't her job that made her want to keep her distance from the handsome-as-sin sheriff.There was a touch of judgment in his dark eyes and a command to his presence that made her think of dark days in her past&#151;a past she'd finally managed to escape.It had been Lucas who had approached her about renting a room to his younger sister. He'd thought Mariah would be a good influence on flighty, immature Jenny.She popped the top of her soda and took a long swallow. She'd agreed to the idea of a roommate because financially it made sense and because the house was big enough that they could live together without being in each other's pockets.Jenny had moved in two months ago. Mariah had found her to be charming but lacking in confidence, thanks to too much older brother and not enough life experience. It was an added benefit that Jenny and Billy had taken so well to each other. There were a lot of young women Jenny's age who wouldn't want to bother with an eight-year-old boy.Mariah unfastened her hair from the neat ponytail at the nape of her neck and slithered her hands through the thick curls to massage her scalp. Then she leaned her head back against the sofa and released a deep, weary sigh.It had been a long day. She was not only Mayor Richard Welch's secretary, she was also part therapist, errand runner and mommy to the man. Things were particularly hectic now with the mayoral election coming in less than three months. When Richard had won the election that had made him mayor, he'd run unopposed. This election he was facing two worthy opponents.Checking her watch, she figured she had twenty minutes or so to sit and relax before she needed to make supper. Billy and Jenny would be back by six. They were never late for a meal.She must have fallen asleep, for when she opened her eyes again the room held the semidarkness of late twilight. For a moment she was disoriented as to the day and time as she stared around the neat living room.As sleep fell away, she remembered it was Friday night and she'd been waiting for Billy and Jenny to get home from the park. She checked her watch, the first faint alarm went off in her head. Almost seven. They should have been home an hour ago.She pulled herself off the sofa and walked to the front door, trying to ignore the small niggle of worry that whispered in the back of her brain.\"They've been late once before,\" she whispered aloud, as if the audible sound of that thought could ease her concern. The last time, they'd found a stray dog caught in some brambles in the wooded area next to the park. It had taken them hours to calm the frightened mutt and get him untangled.Mariah opened the door, stepped onto the front porch and looked in the direction of the park, hoping to see them hurrying toward the house with a tale of adventure to share. She saw nobody except Roger Olem, three doors down, watering his flowers.In another half hour or so it would be full dark.The humid evening air, redolent with the scent of flowers and sunshine, enveloped her as she left the porch and headed down the sidewalk in the direction of the park. As she made her way, she marveled at the happiness she'd found here.She'd never meant to make Conja Creek, Louisiana, her home. It had simply been a blip on her road map when she'd left Shreveport on her way to anywhere.It had taken only a single night spent at a local bed-and-breakfast to make her fall in love with the small, quaint bayou town.She'd just about given up on happiness before landing here. Eight months ago, life had been about survival, but now she was a respected part of the community, and Billy was happier than she'd ever seen him.She quickened her pace as the park came into view. If they were here, then she needed to have a talk with Jenny about making sure they got home on time when they decided to leave the house for a little fun.Her heart dropped a bit when she saw that nobody sat on the swings or climbed on the jungle gym. The only person she saw in the park was one of her neighbors, Rosaline Graham who, since her husband's death, often spent the hours between dinner and bedtime sitting on a park bench.\"Hi, Rosaline,\" Mariah called to the old woman. \"I don't suppose you've seen my son or Jenny Jamison lately, have you?\"She shook her head. \"Sorry, honey. I just got here a few minutes ago, but I sure haven't seen them.\"The alarm bells that had just been whispering through Mariah's head suddenly pealed so loudly she could barely hear anything else.Maybe they'd chosen another way home. Maybe they were there right now wondering whereshewas. She started back toward home. After several steps she broke into a run, telling herself not to panic. It wasn't as if it were the middle of the night. It was only about seven-thirty.But when she got back to the house, there was still no sign of them. The phone had no messages, and the panic that had tried to take hold of her now grasped her with both hands.She pulled out her address book and grabbed the phone. The reason Billy had been home today and not at his babysitter's was because he'd awakened with a sore throat. Maybe Jenny had taken him to the doctor's office.The fact that Jenny's car was in the driveway didn't matter. From Mariah's house it was a short walk to Main Street, where Dr. Ralph Dell had his offices.Her fingers shook as she punched in the phone number. Normally Mariah was the last to panic, and even though she thought there was surely a logical explanation for Billy and Jenny's absence, she couldn't help the swell of inexplicable fear that filled her chest.By nine o'clock she had called everyone she knew to call. Friends, neighbors and schoolmates of Billy's. None of Billy's friends had seen him that day, nor had anyone seen Jenny.She'd been reluctant to call Lucas, knowing that if Jenny and Billy came home and nothing was seriously wrong, Lucas would reprimand Jenny for the next week for worrying her.But now she had no choice. With each minute that passed, the disquiet she'd felt since waking from her unexpected nap raged into full-blown fear.She punched in the number for the sheriff's office, unsurprised when Lucas himself answered the call. \"Sheriff Jamison.\" His deep, self-confident voice instantly commanded respect.\"Sheriff, it's Mariah Harrington. Have you by any chance seen Jenny or Billy today?\"\"No. Why?\" His voice held a sudden intensity and she could see him in her mind. The tight jaw, the disapproving line trekking across his forehead, the thin press of his lips.\"I'm sure there's a logical explanation, but I've been home since five-thirty and they aren't here.\" Although she tried to maintain her composure, her voice cracked and tears suddenly stung her eyes.\"I'll be right there.\" He didn't wait for her to reply.Mariah hung up the receiver then walked back to the front door and stared outside, watching the night shadows as they moved in to steal the last of the day.Fear clawed up the back of her throat as she realized that within fifteen minutes or so it would be night. Where was Jenny? And, dear God, where was her son?Lucas Jamison climbed into his car and headed for the Harrington home, already forming the words to the lecture he'd deliver to his sister when he saw her.God bless that girl, he thought. Sometimes she just didn't use the brains that she'd been born with. She'd probably taken Billy for ice cream, or decided to get him a burger at the caf&#233; and had neglected to leave a note.He just hoped this little escapade didn't screw up the living arrangement with Mariah. When Jenny's last boyfriend had broken up with her, she'd not only lost the man she'd believed was the love of her life but also her living space. She'd refused to move back to the family home with Lucas and had bunked on a girlfriend's sofa for a couple of weeks.It had been Lucas who approached Mariah about Jenny renting a room from her. He knew Mariah was a widow, alone with her son, and lived in a big enough house that a renter might not be a problem.But that wasn't the real reason he'd approached the mayor's secretary.Despite being only twenty-nine years old, Mariah carried herself like a much older, much more mature woman. No-nonsense and with cold blue eyes that could freeze a man in his path, she could potentially have the steadying effect on Jenny that Lucas had never managed. Or so he hoped.\"Jenny, what have you done this time?\" he muttered as he pulled up to the curb in front of the Harrington house. He hadn't even turned off the engine before Mariah flew out of the house.Her chestnut hair, normally pulled back in a tight ponytail, sprung in wild curls around her petite features, making her look far younger than she appeared when she was at her desk in the mayor's office.He didn't have to ask if Jenny and Billy had shown up.

But what's even more of a miracle is how any woman survives the bizarre twists and turns of the 266-day roller coaster ride that follows. When else but in pregnancy is it &#34;normal&#34; to have emotional meltdowns, frequent heartburn, raging acne, leaking breasts, insatiable hunger, and a human being twisting about in your abdomen? And yet, you can expect to gain more than extra weight during pregnancy&mdash;you get a whole new respect for your body and its ability to grow a human being; a stronger connection to the person who helped you create your baby; and a deeper level of fulfi llment as you cross into the realm of parenthood.Countdown to Babywill help you survive this peculiar, emotional, life-altering journey by highlighting your accomplishments as your pregnancy progresses and enabling you to take an active role every step of the way. Each new day brings an update on your baby's growth, insight regarding the changes happening to your own body, and tips for keeping both you and baby as happy and healthy as possible.Countdown to Babyis more than a guide&mdash;it's a personal diary; an opportunity to describe your experience of pregnancy so you can track patterns and symptoms, release frustrations or concerns, and build a keepsake of this unique time in your life.Countdown to Babyrewards you with new insight and helps you look forward to each day of your remarkable countdown from Day 266 (conception) to Day 1 (your baby's due date)! Savor the highs and lows as you edge closer and closer to the moment that makes it all worthwhile&mdash;meeting your baby for the first time.How to Use This JournalYour doctor or midwife should give you a due date at your fi rst prenatal appointment. Enter this date in the space provided at the back of the book next to Day 1. Use a calendar to fi ll in the rest of the dates working backward to Day 266 (conception). While this journal begins on the day your child was conceived, your medical provider will date your pregnancy from the fi rst day of your last menstrual period (LMP), which is about two weeks earlier. To eliminate any confusion, both forms of measurement (Gestational Week and LMP Week) are provided. The fi rst two weeks of this journal describe events that happened before you even knew you were pregnant. Space is provided to describe how you remember feeling in those very early weeks of pregnancy. If you don't remember how you felt, start your personal entries on that unforgettable day when you found out that you were pregnant.", "title": "Countdown to Baby: A Day-by-Day Journal for Moms-to-Be", "price": 16.23, "salesRank": {"Books": 1249453}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tsMViUkmL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1594745730", "1449418465", "158479965X", "0756637236", "1594745978", "0761148574", "0738210072"], "bought_together": ["0761148574"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0307336182", "0307886417", "1402278136", "0761148574"]}}

{"asin": "0373892055", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Lingerie is one of life's pleasures. Shouldn't it be something you love? If you've been reaching into your underwear drawer every day for the same old style of panties, putting yourself into an uncomfortable bra or thinking you don't look good in lingerie, we have news. Whether you have minimal cleavage, an ample booty, or an apple- or pear-shaped body, there is beautiful lingerie out there for you!The state of your underthings can actually change your state of mind. How many of us have picked a pair of panties we liked because we were feeling good that day? Or rummaged around our drawers for a pair we disliked because we woke up feeling down in the dumps? Instead, imagine putting on sexy French lingerie underneath your business suit and feeling excited and empowered, or putting on a flirty bra beneath a T-shirt and feeling feminine and confident.Lingerie should be chosen with as much care and thought as you choose your makeup. You need the perfect foundation before you start making yourself beautiful with blush, mascara, eyeliner. Lingerie is the same way. A foundation that fits well means more-flattering clothing. Your undergarments can make or break your look: smooth T-shirt bras make that tight white T look like a million bucks; the right panties under tight pants will have people doing a double take (and not because you have visible panty lines); and shapewear can smooth out lumps and bumps in that clingy cocktail dress. We could go on and on. And we will.Just like fashion, lingerie is a form of self-expression. When you pair a corset top with a pencil skirt, or switch out plain hosiery with nude fishnets, you're showing your sense of style and making a statement.Intimate apparel also mimics fashion by following color and cultural trends. You probably wouldn't wear the same style of shoes for years on end, so it's logical that your tastes and choices in lingerie also evolve and change through the decades.In our twenties, we primarily dress in lingerie for our men. In our thirties, we learn to wear and appreciate lingerie for ourselves. In our forties, we can either run into a rut or learn about new styles and how to wear them. In our fifties and beyond, we may feel basics are the way to go, or we may choose to splurge on luxury lingerie as a treat. As decades go by, we discover that wearing lingerie transcends putting on a bra that fits. It's more about embracing our femininity, enjoying our bodies and cherishing ourselves.No matter your age, with the help of this book you will learn how to enjoy lingerie in everyday wear, transforming the concept of &#34;underwear&#34; into lingerie you love. Both lingerie virgins and veterans will gain insight into their own lingerie styles and receive practical tips on how to confdently and correctly wear intimate apparel. From bras to hosiery, we'll sort it all out and expose what these underpinnings are all about. We'll suggest brands for every shape and budget. Brides-to-be will benefit from our tips on wedding and honeymoon lingerie. We'll give you a little history lesson, chronicling important lingerie dates, events and milestones. We will even give you seduction scenarios&mdash;in the event your imagination runs less than wild.All you'll need to do is invest a bit of time determining your style and needs. We'll hold your hand and walk you through it. Trust us, it will be well worth the investment. Think you're alone in the process? Au contraire! We have included personal stories from women of all ages and with all different body types about their escapades and experiences with lingerie.So let's get going and find out what'sreallyunderneath it all. But before we do, here's a little about us and how we came to write this book.Jen: My Love Affair with LingerieWhen I grew up in the 1980s, lingerie was as much a part of fashion as it was part of pop culture. If you remember the lace anklet socks and pumps, you know what I'm talking about. From a young age I was significantly influenced by the fusion of lingerie and everyday wear.In junior high I worshipped Madonna: I sported white, fingerless lace gloves and layered multiple lace shirts over my training bra. I even donned a fake above-the-lip mole one year at camp. (It was eyeliner; shhh, don't tell anyone.) By the time I was in high school, it seemed like a natural progression to shop at Victoria's Secret and Frederick's of Hollywood at the local mall.As a high school sophomore I wore fishnets under my cutoff jeans. I dressed in a garter belt with thigh highs under skirts at sixteen. At nineteen I frequented a local reggae venue in northern California, where I wore a burgundy velvet bra and not much else. The doorman never carded me. I felt feminine and powerful&mdash;and I still can't believe my mom let me out of the house. By the time I finished college, lingerie was a beloved part of my wardrobe, something that held memories of hot summer concerts and adventurous young love.On a trip to France in 2001, my boyfriend&mdash;now husband&mdash;and I found ourselves in a little shop on the Champs-&#201;lys&#233;es called Lise Charmel. He bought me a sheer, black demi bra and knickers set with delicate, red foral embroidery. It was breathtaking. Even on sale, it cost more than one hundred and fifty dollars. I couldn't believe he splurged like that. Later, when I put the set on for the first time, I felt completely transformed. My man gasped when I walked out of our hotel bathroom.I couldn't stop smiling. It was then I discovered the true power of lingerie&mdash;and also developed my champagne taste for underwear.My love of lingerie drove me to open my own shop in Seattle a year later. The journey has been educational and never dull. Helping women with their underthings is a very intimate experience, and it requires a lot of trust on each customer's part. I assist women in finding their actual bra size, which celebrates and enhances their breasts: &#34;Yes, my love, youarea 34C, not a 36A. Enjoy!&#34; I also specialize in picking out the perfect cut and style of lingerie for each woman's body type. It has been extremely gratifying to help women express themselves through their lingerie, while encouraging them to have fun along the way.The idea for this book came about over cocktails with some girlfriends. Following a couple of margaritas, the conversation turned to how to wear lingerie for a man. After an entertaining and educational discussion&mdash;and more than a few hoots and hollers&mdash;my friends said, &#34;You should write a book!&#34; I considered my conversations over the years with customers and their questions about lingerie, from practical to naughty, and I realized women could use a lingerie book about what to wear and how to wear it.As for my personal relationship with lingerie, these days my routine has simplifed. As a wife, mother and business owner, I don't see nightlife very often and don't always have time to pamper myself. My intimate apparel is one thing I don't skimp on, so I always have a little luxury in my daily life. I feel alluring when I put on a beautiful nightgown before bed, and I feel put together because my bra and panties match and are flattering. But most of all, I adore the realization that I am taking care of myself by loving the first thing I put on my body: my underwear. Frankly, I deserve this little bit of luxury&mdash;all women do.Thus, my love affair with lingerie continues. This book is dedicated to all you lovely ladies who are ready for a new adventure. Enjoy!Kathy: My Life in LingerieMy earliest memories of falling in love with lingerie were in a St. Louis auto repair garage in the 1960s. My grandfather owned it and my father worked there with him. (I know it sounds bad, but stay with me here.) When I was a child, Mom would stop at the shop and my siblings and I would pile out of the car and say hi to Dad and Grandpa. We loved going there. Grandpa had a pop machine with a secret hand crank. We'd open the door and help ourselves to sodas, either chocolate or Vess cream. Grandpa gave us pennies for the peanut machine. We'd punch the green buttons on the circa-1940s adding machine, run up the incline on the wheel alignment rack and receive &#34;rides&#34; on the air jack from my dad. Standing on the hose, Dad would flip the air jack switch and up we'd go a couple feet. It was all great fun.But one of my favorite activities was sneaking peeks at the pinup girl calendar behind the desk. The calendars were New Year's gifts from auto parts suppliers and the Snap-on tool company. I loved looking at the Vargas Girls, sexy watercolor and airbrushed paintings by Alberto Vargas from the 1940s. Lithe and well-endowed women with red-painted nails appeared in scanty lingerie, black stockings, tap pants, see-through nighties, diaphanous peignoir sets and mules. They were so exotic! I couldn't wait until Grandpa turned the calendar on the first of the month to see a new ensemble. I dreamed of the day I would be grown-up enough to wear these &#34;outfits.&#34;Fast-forward a few years to my first underwire bra in high school. I read they were an important invention to keep breasts from sagging. No one wore them then, and my best friend teased me mercilessly and called me Wire Woman. I also discovered colored panties in wild prints and&mdash;gasp!&mdash;black. I felt sexy in my sheer, shimmery nude bra in the 1970s. It was perfect under my body-hugging tops paired with bell-bottoms and platforms.In the 1980s I discovered teddies and garter belts. What fun! My first teddies came in dusty rose and teal. I stepped outside the box and bought a red garter belt. I splurged on a merry widow. I scanned Frederick's of Hollywood catalogs for fishnet stockings. I bought matching bra and panty sets along with lots of colored lingerie and black, lacy underthings. My underwear drawer was flling up with naughty delights.Despite my adventurousness, I could have used some guidance. I almost always wore the wrong bra size. I was close, but no banana, buying too big a band size and too small a cup size. In the late 1980s I finally got a fitting...--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Underneath It All: A Girl's Guide to Buying, Wearing and Loving Lingerie", "price": 9.09, "salesRank": {"Books": 409474}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A0t-yPqpL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0761143238", "1936984040", "0761174753", "1933771941", "158005207X", "0976876000", "1841729760", "0764339303", "156158309X", "0785826726", "0983132844", "0785826718", "1291047247", "006221974X", "0312271417", "0764328182", "1584795271", "0486476499", "1419702157", "1856696502"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0761143238", "1291047247", "B00CC6IEHQ", "1933771941"]}}

We've got crazy/busy schedules, our bodies keep changing, our best buds are acting weird, our parents are bugging&#151;and we're stressing from all the pressure to be and do a lot of different things (some of which are impossible, like getting the mean girl to hike it to another school or dating a Jonas Brother!)I hope this book will help young girls everywhere transition into their teenage years with a positive attitude, tons of girl power, and the inspiration to be and appreciate yourself for simply BEING YOU! (Remember: it's cool to be different.) I like to think of113 Things To Do By 13as the go-to guide to being a hip n' happening n' totally competent tweenager! More than 100 peeps contributed their expertise and packed the following pages with tips on everything from the coolest fashion musts to Ply crafts to smart-girl advice on gossip, cyber-bullying, crushes, body issues, and making big dreams happen at a young age. Even a few of our fave celebs, like Selena Gomez and the Camp Rock gals, shared their teen survival tips.So, jump to your favorite section or read it cover-to-cover! May you enjoy reading113 Things To Do By 13,as much as I liked writing it and discovering for myself why 13 is such an awesome age. Hey, there's plenty of time (at least a few years) to stress about getting our license, college, and not to mention that&#133;work thing. So, let's kick off our teen years in a super fab way&151;and celebrate all the great things we can do and learn right now.", "title": "113 Things To Do By 13 (Stonesong Press Book)", "price": 13.15, "salesRank": {"Books": 853092}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51btBpnMEBL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1598697137", "1416979107", "0802777449"], "bought_together": ["1598697137"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1579908594", "0802777449", "1598697137"]}}

{"asin": "0373892098", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Pediatricians bring hope and help to our patients. We have the expertise gained through education and training to lend help to those in need. We provide assistance and information, formulate plans and support parents and children to give them hope. For children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and their families, however, help and hope are not always easy to find.Although I considered myself a well-trained and experienced pediatrician, when I encountered my first child with an autism diagnosis twenty years ago, I had little knowledge of it. When I first met Ryan and his family, whom you will meet through these pages, autism was about to emerge in epidemic proportions far exceeding professional understanding and services. Those services that were available tended to be education based but not medically based. Most doctors, including myself, were woefully underprepared to help these families. However, the networks I had built over the years afforded me access to a wide range of contacts. Casting a wide net across the country, I eventually obtained information to help support not only Ryan but also, ultimately, many children with ASD.My search led to Drs. Stanley I. Greenspan and Serena Wieder, who proved to be superb mentors. They introduced me to the DIR model, a unique developmental approach to assessing and interacting with children, especially those who have delays. As I observed this treatment approach for the first time in my journey, I saw children with autism who were joyful, relating and communicating with their families&#151;each in their own ways. This inspired me to adopt this model into my existing medical practice.By 1998, it seemed that the number of children diagnosed with ASD was increasing daily. This convinced me to devote my practice solely to this group of children. At that time, my pediatric colleagues questioned whether there would be enough work in this field to sustain a viable practice. Within months my new practice &#34;wait list&#34; had grown shockingly to over one thousand children and families in need!InAutism Solutions,I share my medical and developmental evaluation and treatment paradigm. As I saw more and more children with autism, medical patterns became evident. These children had numerous symptoms, in addition to their significant developmental delays. It was not unusual to find a child with a history of chronic diarrhea or constipation, allergies, potential seizures, severe sleep problems and recurrent infections. Behavior symptoms such as tics, aggression, hyperactivity and impulsivity, as well as debilitating anxiety, were common. Most of these concerns were not addressed by the prevailing explanations for ASD, were largely unrecognized and were poorly treated. Somehow the diagnosis of autism had clouded the fact that these were children who could experience the same childhood illnesses as any other child. It was also possible that certain chronic symptoms might even be related to their autism. In my entire career I had never met a more medically underserved group of children.This was unacceptable to me. It was time to look at these children through a new lens. Yes, they might have developmental delays but they also showed intelligence (some superior) and untapped capabilities. Often their medical issues derailed their progress. By looking at each child individually, each with his own strengths and challenges, a unique profile could be developed. From this profile, a targeted treatment plan emerged that was tailored to his needs. Working together with families to discover ways they could relate and communicate with their children gave them renewed energy and hope. With increased hope came increased expectations for each child.Treating a child's medical problems allowed him to feel better. When he felt better, he was more available to interact, develop relationships, get the most from his therapies and, eventually, make great developmental gains. When addressing all of a child's challenges appropriately, I witnessed changes that were unheard of at that time. Once the parents understood how their child interpreted the world, the door was opened to deepening their relationship. To see the happiness they had when their child related and communicated was extremely moving to me. I was convinced then&#151;and more so today&#151;that this powerful approach can significantly impact children's lives.Research over the past decade continues to confirm the presence of medical issues in children with ASD. Yet in the early 1990s, very little research had been funded in the field of autism. At that time, I was fortunate to meet Jon Shestack and Portia Iverson, parents searching for answers for their son Dov, who had been diagnosed with ASD. They invited me to join the initial group of five, who met around their kitchen table, thinking about ways to stimulate research into the cause of and treatments for ASD. From these meetings (and due in large part to the courage and persistence ofJon and Portia), Cure Autism Now (CAN) was born&#151;now called Autism Speaks. I was fortunate as a CAN board member to be able to immerse myself in the science, meeting many dedicated researchers trying to discover answers to the mysteries of ASD. Also about that time, I joined the founding board of the Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental and Learning Disorders (ICDL), an organization dedicated to educating professionals who work with children with ASD in relationship-based approaches. Through the ICDL November Research Conference and the Summer Institute, I have met and learned from hundreds of devoted professionals. Being privy to the newest in research and learning how to better support these children gave me a unique opportunity to provide the most up-to-date help to the children and their families in my practice.Doctors learn the art of medicine from their patients, and mine have taught me volumes. I have been so privileged to be a participant in the journey of children with ASD and their families&#151;in some cases for nearly twenty years. Each and every child has taught me over and over again to look beyond their behaviors to their uniqueness. In these pages you will meet many of these children. By addressing their abilities and adjusting their treatment plan to fit their needs over time, I have watched them make astounding progress. I have seen them grow to become related, creative, interesting, empathetic young adults, each blazing his own unique trail&#151;often one never imagined for individuals with ASD. I expect this for your child, too.Autism Solutionsincludes information covering both the developmental and medical concerns that parents, families and friends so often seek.&#9632;&nbsp;Part I introduces autism and its potential causes.&#9632;&nbsp;Part II reviews the nature of our sensory-motor systems and how an infant's development unfolds, as well as the unique developmental model that allows you to better understand your child's strengths and challenges.&#9632;&nbsp;Part III presents my approach to the evaluation and development of treatment plans. I hope you will feel as if you are sitting in the office with me as we explore all the potential concerns for your child and help you formulate the necessary elements for his treatment plan, tailored to his needs and the needs of your family.&#9632;&nbsp;Part IV reviews communication issues&#151;both learning how to interpret your child's behavior as a means to letting you know what he is thinking and feeling, as well as ways to support the most challenged children who have severe motor-planning delays.&#9632;&nbsp;Part V addresses the medical issues that may affect your child. I have tried to demystify &#34;doctorspeak&#34; so that you will be armed with useful information to help you get appropriate medical care for your child.In addition, you should be able to ask your doctor the questions most important to solving issues as they come up.&#9632; Part VI puts all of this into the big picture of why you are working to get your child all the support he needs&#151;so he will be prepared to live a happy and meaningful life.Most of the concepts are illustrated by stories of children I've seen in my practice. In general, names have been changed to protect their privacy. In most cases, unless a girl is featured in a story, you will notice I have used &#34;he&#34; in describing a child with ASD. This has been done for consistency and simplicity.As you seek solutions for your child with autism, you should always be in the driver's seat&#151;no one knows your child better than you; no one cares for your child more than you; no one can advocate better for your child than you. This book will give you information that empowers you to remain central to the process. Your journey may be an extended one, with peaks and valleys, but it is one worth taking.

To help women, who, Harvard gastroenterologist Wolf states, are particularly vulnerable, mark differences between normal digestive and bowel function, chronic problems eroding life satisfaction, and life-threatening conditions, she describes risks and symptoms for gas, heartburn, acid reflux, constipation, diarrhea and food poisoning; colitis; gallstone, Crohn's and celiac diseases; irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease (IBS/IBD); and esophageal, stomach, and colon cancers. Wolf covers diet and lifestyle choices that cause or contribute to relatively minor problems; warning signs of serious conditions; the myriad available tests, treatments and medications; impact of digestive disorders on pregnant women; and links between such disorders, PMS, and endometriosis. Wolf's accessible q&amp;a format, personal stories, easygoing humor, and practical concern for tight budgets and work schedules will relieve much of the anxiety and shame that, she says, prevent many women from seeking appropriate medical care. With her many insights and tips for choosing sympathetic health care providers, Wolf's proactive approach should encourage readers who have become resigned to making the bathroom the center of their lives.

{"asin": "0373892144", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "On Halloween in 2003, Host was given terrifying news: she had carcinoid tumor, a rare and deadly form of cancer . The wife and mother of three children (then ages 10 months, 11 and 13), who is now in remission, was given a prognosis of 18 to 36 months. In this heartfelt narrative, Host attempts to simultaneously fight the disease and find peace with the possibility of death while remaining strong and hopeful. The author describes the moments of comfort and joy she receives from those around her, but she doesn't flinch from the realities of life-threatening illness. Regarding one particularly harrowing hospital stay, she recalls, I thought I had already earned my doctorate in pain, but it turns out I was wrong. She finds humor among the indignities cancer patients must endure, writing, for example, I should have known that, as a mother of three, the only possible way to get 12 uninterrupted hours of sleep would be surgery. Host's honest depiction of her personal experiences also captures the universal aspects of cancer. In one of the book's entries, dated nearly two years after her initial diagnosis, Host recounts a conversation with a stranger, a fellow train passenger: We have that instant connection that you make with someone who has suffered the loss that cancer can bring.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0373892446", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "It was a Thursday, around 6&#58;00 pm, and I was sitting in my office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, located along a tree-lined stretch of Alewife Brook Parkway, a few miles outside of Harvard Square.The four-story brick building, an annex of Massachusetts General Hospital&#39;s psychiatry department, is where I see patients as part of my research and teaching responsibilities at Harvard Medical School. They span the age and occupation spectrum&#151;elementary-school children, grandparents, lawyers, salesmen, housewives and house-husbands&#151;but they have one thing in common: they are coming to see me and my colleagues with familiar complaints and concerns. &#34;I know I could be doing better&#34; is a common one; as is, &#34;I can&#39;t go on like this.&#34;While the complaints may vary slightly, the symptoms they describe are the same&#151;and consistent with the condition we treat. You&#39;ve probably heard of it: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).One of those patients, we&#39;ll call her Jill, is late for her appointment.As I sit catching up on e-mails, the door bursts open and in she flies, out of breath from climbing the two flights of stairs to my second-floor office. She is flustered and clearly upset.&#34;Sorry I&#39;m late!&#34; Jill says, as she plops down on the chair facing my desk. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t believe my day.&#34;&#34;Try me,&#34; I say. &#34;Take a deep breath and tell me what&#39;s going on.&#34;Jill is in her late thirties and a highly educated research scientist, one of the many &#34;knowledge workers&#34; who labor in Cambridge, home of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She takes a moment and launches into her story, which begins a few weeks earlier when she temporarily moved into a friend&#39;s apartment while her own house was being renovated.&#34;Last night, when I came in,&#34; she says, &#34;I put my keys down somewhere, and this morning, I had not a clue where they could be.&#34;I nod. I have a feeling I know where this is going.&#34;I looked everywhere&#151;the usual places, which of course are not the usual places, as it&#39;s not my place. My friend, she really is a good friend, but I am wondering if she has more trouble than I do. You think I am disorganized, you should see her place&#133;&#34;I know this is the right time to jump in and direct our conversation back to the issue at hand or&#151;like this morning&#151;Jill could continue running in verbal circles and not getting anywhere. &#34;Okay, so, you were looking for your keys &#133;?&#34; Jill smiles. &#34;Oh, right, yes, I was flipping out. I spent thirty minutes trying to find my car keys.&#34;Jill then stops, shaking her head.&#34;Well, did you find them?&#34; I ask.She nods ruefully. &#34;Eventually.&#34;&#34;Where were they?&#34;&#34;Right on my friend&#39;s kitchen table! And, of course, I&#39;d walked back and forth through the kitchen ten times while I was looking for them. All that time they were right there&#133;right there in front of me. Unbelievable!&#34;&#34;Sounds very frustrating&#133;but pretty believable, as those keys have eluded you before.&#34; Jill smiles ruefully, and I press on. &#34;Then what happened?&#34;&#34;My day was in shambles from that point on.&#34; Jill went on to relate how the half hour she&#39;d spent looking for the keys set off a domino effect of tardiness and inefficiency&#151;problems galore. She arrived at work late for a meeting and opened the door to the conference room just in time to interrupt an important point that one of her company&#39;s head honchos was making. Embarrassed and angry at herself, she returned from the meeting and finally got in front of her computer to find a barrage of e-mail reminders that further annoyed and overwhelmed her. She sent out a flurry of responses, including a snippy reply to the wrong person, who was not happy to get it (neither was the correct recipient, when she eventually cleared up the mistake). Dealing with her e-mail gaffe kept her from attending to a project due by noon. Her deadline blown, she skipped lunch, scrambling to get her work done, and what she did hand in&#151;two hours late&#151;was subpar and received with something less than an enthusiastic response by her supervisor.In other words, it was a crummy day for Jill. It wasn&#39;t the first time such a day had begun with something misplaced or by an episode of forgetfulness, but the snowball effect of losing her keys still surprised and upset her.&#34;This happens all the time,&#34; Jill says, teary-eyed, angry and ashamed. &#34;At this rate, I could lose my job &#133;just because I can&#39;t keep track of stupid things like keys.&#34;I&#39;m sorry to hear that Jill is upset, but her story is not unusual. Jill has ADHD&#151;and she is certainly not alone. It&#39;s estimated that about 4 percent of adults and 5&#151;7 percent of children in this country meet the medical criteria for ADHD. It&#39;s equally safe to estimate that at some point in their lives almost everyone hasfeltas if they have ADHD, too. The symptoms of ADHD include forgetfulness, impulsiveness, losing items, making careless errors, being easily distracted and lacking focus. Who hasn&#39;t exhibited one of these symptoms in the last few days &#133;or even hours? Who hasn&#39;t lost their car keys? Who hasn&#39;t been distracted in the car (once the keys are located), on the job or at home&#151;by a text, a tweet, an e-mail, a cell phone ring? Who hasn&#39;t been late for a meeting or missed a deadline or made a mistake because they were disorganized that day, lost focus that morning or were distracted that minute? That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you have ADHD, but it does suggest you might be part of the distracted masses that now make up such a large part of our society. If so, you&#39;ve come to the right place because we&#39;re going to show you how to get back on track.Whether or not you have ADHD&#151;and chances are, you probably don&#39;t&#151;the purpose of this book is to inform, inspire and organize your brain. Whether forgetfulness is a &#34;symptom&#34; of a disorder for a person like Jill or an &#34;issue&#34; for someone else who doesn&#39;t have the same degree of severity, this book will approach it in a straightforward way&#151;and with equally straightforward and effective solutions.What was first labeled the &#34;Distraction Epidemic&#34; bySlatemagazine in 2005 has now reached epic proportions, right up there with the obesity epidemic and is of no less import than that or other public health crises that have befallen modern society. In a 2009New Yorkmagazine story on the attention crisis, David Meyer of the University of Michigan described it as nothing less than &#34;a cognitive plague that has the potential to wipe out an entire generation of focused and productive thought&#34; and has drawn comparisons to the insidious damage of nicotine addiction.&#34;People aren&#39;t aware of what&#39;s happening to their mental processes,&#34; says Meyer, &#34;in the same way that people years ago couldn&#39;t look into their lungs and see the residual deposits.&#34; The difference here is that unlike the &#34;mad men&#34; of the 1950s and 1960s who went around merrily sucking up packs of unfiltered Camels, seemingly oblivious to the harmful effects, most of us today know that we are having problems staying focused, paying attention and maintaining some sense of order in our lives.Unlike smoking (which you either do or don&#39;t do), it&#39;s not just the people afflicted by the most serious and definable form of distraction and disorganization&#151;ADHD&#151;who are affected by this epidemic. Ask friends, family members and colleagues how they&#39;re doing, and chances are, the responses will usually include words like &#34;frazzled,&#34; &#34;stressed,&#34; &#34;overwhelmed&#34; and &#34;trying to keep my head above water.&#34; In casual conversation, you often hear people talking about &#34;brain freezes,&#34; &#34;blanking out&#34; on something or suffering &#34;senior moments&#34; (often, when they really aren&#39;t very senior). All of them &#133;all of us &#133;are affected to some degree by the epidemic.To get back to my patient Jill in the four-story brick building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I knew that the woman with the lost keys and the lousy day was not one of the millions complaining to each other about how crazed their lives have become. She has a clinical disorder; most do not. But, as I listened to Jill&#39;s story, I also knew the potential power of a rather simple solution that could help her and many others.A couple of weeks earlier, during one of our regular sessions, Jill and I had somehow gotten on to the topic of the Apollo lunar landing. We talked about the coverage of the fortieth anniversary of that historic moment, the spectacle of the great Saturn rocket that hurled the astronauts into space, how exciting it still was to see the old black-and-white images of Aldrin and Armstrong on the moon and hear their voices crackling over the television from Tranquility Base and about whether we&#39;d ever go back.The memory of that conversation about the space program and her interest in it gave me the language needed to help frame the solution for Jill.&#34;So, I have a thought about how to start your day tomorrow,&#34; I say. &#34;As we&#39;ve been talking about, we are working on bringing order into your life, changing old patterns that don&#39;t work with new ones that do.&#34;&#34;Right, that sounds good,&#34; she says attentively. &#34;What&#39;s your idea?&#34;&#34;You need alaunch padfor your keys.&#34;Her eyebrows raise quizzically.&#34;A launch pad,&#34; I repeat. &#34;A place where you always put your keys and maybe your ID and glasses, too.

After an initial misdiagnosis and months of denying the seriousness of her condition, Karz faced the devastating reality that, as a type 1 diabetic, she would have to take insulin injections for the rest of her life, check her blood-sugar levels at least 10 times a day and was at a high risk for infection and even amputation. Karz details the ups and downs of her childhood, illness and 16-year NYCB career, from a low-blood-sugar episode that almost derailed a performance in Copenhagen to dancing with George Balanchine himself at a School of American Ballet rehearsal; being cast as theNutcracker's Sugar Plum Fairy; and her promotion to soloist six years after her diagnosis. Karz's prose is simple, and although ballet fans may wish for more insider gossip, Karz offers a satisfying portrait of a dancer making her mark at a competitive world-class company. Diabetics and athletes in particular will gain inspiration from her perseverance, acceptance and control of a debilitating disease.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
