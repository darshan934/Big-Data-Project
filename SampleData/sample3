{"asin": "1592871011", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Janice Weizman takes readers back to ninth-century Babylonia in this interesting debut novel. Rahel Bat Yair is the seventeen-year-old daughter of a Jewish physician in Sura, a city south of Baghdad. Her mother died giving birth to her and her father raised and educated her. When he accepts a position as an advisor to the governor, an anti-Semitic member of the governor's entourage murders him and Rahel is forced to defend herself. After killing the murderer, Rahel flees, leading to many adventures throughout the Islamic, Jewish, and Christian communities between the Tigris and the Euphrates. She spends time in a monastery, has an ill-fated love affair, and eventually finds her way back to the Jewish community in the Galilee. Rahel is a strong, learned woman, determined to survive despite the adversity in her life. The author's attention to historical detail adds color to an action-packed story that will keep readers turning the pages. Book clubs will enjoy this book. The role of women in ancient societies, arranged marriages, religion, and slavery provide many issues for discussion. --Barbara M. Bibel, Jewish Book World MagazineThe Wayward Moon is a magnificent piece of historical fiction and a startlingly beautiful portrayal of a strong woman in an era when women were expected to be only a man's wife and mother to his children. The Wayward Moon is her first full-length novel. --Hilary Daninhirsch, Fall 2012 - ForeWord Review, August 30, 2012FictionThe Wayward MoonJanice Weizman. Yotzeret Publishing (Partners Publishers Group, dist.), $14.95 trade paper (328p) ISBN 978-1-59287-101-8In  her debut novel, Toronto-born Weizman, who now lives in Israel and is  founder and editor of the Ilanot Review, explores Islamic history  through crises confronted by women. The action in the story&mdash;and there&rsquo;s  lots of it&mdash; takes place in the ninth century, mostly in what is now  Iraq. The first-person narrator, 17-year-old Rahel Bat Yair, is the  daughter of a Jewish physician in Sura, south of Baghdad. Her mother  died giving birth to Rahel, and her father raised and educated her. He  arranges her marriage and accepts a position as advisor to the governor;  the latter action enrages an anti-Semitic member of the governor&rsquo;s  entourage, leading to a bloody confrontation in which the doctor is  killed and Rahel slays the murderer. She flees and her subsequent  exciting adventures, from a stint in a monastery to an ill-fated love  affair, occupy the rest of the book. She eventually finds her way back  to the Jewish community in the Galilee area and writes her story. This  melodrama holds the reader&rsquo;s interest as the strong-willed Rahel  weathers this series of disasters.

{"asin": "1592910327", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Ellis's Apparat comics were originally published as four first issues of otherwise hypothetical series, drawn by four different artists&mdash;an experiment in imagining what comics would be like if they'd evolved from the pulp magazines of the '30s instead of superheroes. The conceit extends to their visual style: Carla Speed McNeil's rough, chiseled art for the compassionate hardboiled detective story \"Frank Ironwine,\" for instance, draws more on pulp traditions than spandex conventions. Ellis's dark SF world of a future dragged down by humanity's own frailties has power, but the one-shot nature of the series sometimes works against it. \"Angel Stomp Future\" (drawn in magnificently gross, squirming detail by Juan Jose Ryp) is supposed to be science fiction, but Ellis gets so caught up in a lecture about his pet themes that he neglects to give it a plot, and the aviator comic \"Quit City\" (with clear-lined, photo-inspired art by Laurenn McCubbin) devotes most of its space to setting up characters we'll never see again. The most intriguing story here is \"Simon Spector,\" about a brutal, Shadow/Doc Savage&ndash;inspired hero whose \"supersane\" high-speed thought is fueled by potent drugs. Curiously, both Ellis's script and Jacen Burrows's art suggest superhero comics' style more than any other story here.(Nov.)Correction: In the Oct. 24 Q&amp;A with Dennis Cooper, the publisher of his novelGod Jr.was misstated.

His full list of writing credits is nothing short of extraordinary; his career highlights include Judge Dredd, Hellblazer, The Demon, Hitman, Punisher, The Pro, War Story, and The Boys. Over the past ten years, Ennis has published numerous acclaimed and fan-favorite projects through Avatar Press, including Dicks, Chronicles Of Wormwood, 303, Streets Of Glory, and the wildly successful Crossed series. He wrote and directed his first film, Stitched, which Avatar Press will continue as an ongoing comic book series illustrated by Mike Wolfer.

{"asin": "1592911749", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A cornerstone of the modern comic industry, Garth Ennis is most easily recognized as the creator of Preacher, one of the best-selling graphic novel series of all time. His full list of writing credits is nothing short of extraordinary; his career highlights include Judge Dredd, Hellblazer, The Demon, Hitman, Punisher, The Pro, War Story, and The Boys. Over the past ten years, Ennis has published numerous acclaimed and fan-favorite projects through Avatar Press, including Dicks, Chronicles Of Wormwood, 303, Streets Of Glory, and the wildly successful Crossed series. He wrote and directed his first film, Stitched, which Avatar Press will continue as an ongoing comic book series illustrated by Mike Wolfer. Jacen Burrows is truly one of the rising stars in comic book illustration. Working exclusively with Avatar Press through the years, his skillful talents have brought to life the visions of such comic book luminaries as Alan Moore (Neonomicon) and Warren Ellis (Scars). After early collaborations with Garth Ennis on 303, a war story set in Afghanistan, and Chronicles Of Wormwood, a tale of a reluctant, butt-kicking Anti-Christ, he tackled Crossed, defining the look of its bleak world and laying the groundwork for the most successful horror franchise in comics. Jamie Delano is a pioneer of Mature Readers comic storytelling, his reputation cemented as the first person to chronicle the solo exploits of John Constantine in Hellblazer. Among the dozens of gritty, groundbreaking projects under his belt, and prior to his work on Crossed, Delano published two creator-owned series at Avatar Press, Narcopolis and Rawbone. The former is a science fiction epic of one man's rebellion against a bizarre world of twisted authority and chemical influence; the latter is a gut-wrenching horror tale of murderous pirates and damned souls.", "title": "Crossed Volume 4 TP", "price": 26.77, "salesRank": {"Books": 94668}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DScUs5zDL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1592911528", "1592911854", "1592911242", "1592912060", "1592910904", "1592911706", "1592912109", "1592912222", "1592912265", "1592911889", "1592911803", "159291215X", "160690373X", "1592912427", "1592911080", "1607066599", "1606903411", "0785157778", "1607067544", "1606901257", "160690082X", "1592911773", "1592911625", "1933305738", "1933305681", "1607068605", "1606900358", "1606902644", "1606901508", "1933305924", "159291229X", "1606902075", "1632150301", "1592912311", "1592912079", "1606902202", "1607068826", "1592911250", "1607062739", "1616550325", "1592912184", "160706555X", "1607066157", "1401237347", "1607069466", "1401237185", "1607069385", "1607066874", "1607062747", "140123691X", "1607066777", "1632151146", "1607067358", "1607065266", "1607062755", "1563897156", "1607067412", "1607066211", "1607069318", "1607068184", "1607067706", "1607066017", "1401240453", "1401237703", "1401237231", "1607068559", "160706846X", "1607065290", "1592912346", "1613772270", "1607067536", "1592912141", "1592910998", "1563894904", "0785162305", "1607067676", "1608862755", "1607068095", "1563895196", "1592911935", "0785116036", "1607066084", "1607067846", "1607066920", "1613778538", "0785165924", "1607066181", "1563896176", "1607067269", "1606903357", "0785166106", "1401248853", "160690261X", "140123769X", "1607068362", "1607069628", "1563893126", "1607065169", "0785117318", "160706961X"], "bought_together": ["1592911528", "1592911854"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1592911242", "1592910904", "1592911528", "1592911854"]}}

{"asin": "159287102X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "\"In Yael Unterman's stunning debut collectionThe Hidden of Things, she presents her readers with a gallery of compelling characters in headlong pursuit of the spirit and the flesh. That they often find these goals to be mutually exclusive turns out to be a source of both heartbreak and riotous humor. How she manages to embrace such extremes in stories that are also poignant, passionate, and brave is a mystery whose result is a deeply irresistible experience.\"--Steve Stern, author ofThe Frozen RabbiandThe Book of Mischief\"It would be wrong to characterize Yael Unterman simply as a writer she is a force, a spirit of turbulent and joyful query. Her devotion to ideas, to Jewish thought and literature in particular, to two languages, Hebrew and English, the intersections of Orthodoxy and the contemporary world, can't help but fascinate readers. Her sketches of life in modern Israel and the Diaspora evoke the sweetness and melancholy of Chekhov. Her passion to understand, to find a way to live a life of meaning both in a commitment to tradition and to derech eretz, the way of the world, however, give them the spice of something unique and original. One feels throughoutThe Hidden of Thingsa furious and original energy. These stories are not just witty and insightful. They search the world of modern Jewish life in Jerusalem, the suburb of Katamon, the frustrations and foibles of religious women, for answers. The plight of the woman and man who find themselves single in their early thirties searching references from matchmakers, friends, Internet dating sites for a soul-mate is anatomized often with a breathless laughter.\"--Mark Jay Mirsky, author ofBlue Hill AvenueandDante, Eros and Kabbalah, and editor ofFictionmagazine\"From Zion has come forth an outrageous, wise, and funky voice. I've already started re-reading it, that's how good this book is\" -- Ruchama King Feuerman, author ofIn the Courtyard of the KabbalistandSeven Blessings\"Each story is a jewel strung upon a glittering chain that joins complexity with deep insight. I found it difficult to stop reading. The insights into singleton Orthodox life for women and for men were cogent and compelling. 'Katamonsta' and 'The Hidden of Things' quite blew me away the former with its brash humour flecked with poignant awareness and intelligence, and the latter with its agonising representation of a woman in search of her identity and of peace, possibly in all the wrong places.\" -- Yvonne Fein, author ofApril FoolandThe Torn Messiah\"In this rollicking book simultaneously empathetic, tragic, and comic the playful scenes and the ironies, the joy in language, and the cleverness of the dialogue delight. Unterman has an Austen-esque touch where seemingly small moments are experienced as profound; at the same time, a Malamudian darkness permeates some of the stories and sinks into the soul. But the hiddenness of things in this book is in its female friendships. This hiddenness illuminates a quiet undercurrent of support, compassion, humor, comfort, kindness, and connection. You will find both kinds of blessings in this book: hidden and revealed.\" --Eve Grubin, author ofMorning Prayer", "title": "The Hidden of Things: Twelve Stories of Love &amp; Longing", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 227455}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TRozfZY1L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1590178149", "0062318985", "0827612095", "0802122736", "0544047745", "0805243127", "0300164246", "0691158517", "0385521707", "1565129334", "042524413X", "B007VOKX8C"]}}

As the guiding force behind such horror titles as Night of the Living Dead, Friday the 13th, and Escape of the Living Dead, Wolfer cemented his reputation as one of today's top creators of supernatural tales, a trend has continues with his writing credits on Warren Ellis' Gravel and Garth Ennis' Stitched, both of which he also illustrates. Avatar's sister company, Boundless Comics, has also benefited from Wolfer's flair for the macabre, as he writes both Brian Pulido's Lady Death and the \"bad girl\" extravaganza title, War Goddess. Brian Pulido is a multi-talented writer and movie producer/director known for his edgy brand of pop entertainment. As the President of Chaos Comics, he was the leading independent comic publisher of the 1990&#8217;s; there, he created the fan-favorite character Lady Death and wrote hundreds of creator-owned and licensed comics. Focusing on film work in the new millennium, he returned to comics in 2010, for the first time launching a monthly, ongoing Lady Death series published by Boundless Comics.", "title": "Lady Death Volume 2", "price": 22.52, "salesRank": {"Books": 509845}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N2dRZgMRL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1592911420", "1592911277", "1592911129", "0964226081", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0002MFG0K", "1401235441", "1606904140", "0983040451", "1606902121", "B00EIL7E9C", "1937068374", "1592911676", "1606903373", "1606904329", "1606903241", "1606904884", "1606903713", "1606902474", "1937068366", "1606901753", "193706882X", "1937068897", "1606904310", "1939683238", "1607064278", "1606904248", "1606903365", "0982582609", "1607066815", "160690180X", "1937068617", "1937068676", "1606903950", "1937068315", "1607062062", "1607065320", "1606903632", "1937068838", "1606902652", "1606903888", "1607066378", "1606904256", "1937068412", "1606903446", "1606903942", "1616550635", "1937068331", "193706834X", "1937068811", "1607064936", "1606903896", "1607062127", "1606902253", "1606904795", "1606904892", "1606902415", "1606903780", "160690339X", "1595829393", "1606901958", "1595829040", "1401235611", "1595829172", "1606904639", "1606902067", "1401222048", "1616550627", "1606902318", "1939683009"], "bought_together": ["1592911420", "1592911277"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1592911129", "1592911277", "0964226022", "1592911420"]}}

Groups of children use familiar objects such as rocks, buttons, and jelly beans to count.

The narratives are lively, and the explanations are clear. The colorful layout features large, easy-to-read type and photographs on every spread. The images help to illuminate the concepts discussed and boxes highlight additional information.

With a clean, attractive format, the World of Mammals series features concise chapters accompanied by color photographs (many of them excellent) from a variety of sources. In a departure from most books of wildlife, the first chapter ofpolar Bearsdiscusses the bond between the animal and the Inuit people, who have depended on hunting the bears for survival. Then the discussion turns to the bears themselves: their physical features, behaviors, and relatives as well as the threats to their survival. A world map indicates the polar bear's habitat, and a glossary, classification chart, and short lists of recommended videos and books are appended. Though written in brief sentences, the text will be difficult for some middle-grade students. However, this book and others in the series will suit advanced readers in elementary school as well as middle-school students looking for approachable, illustrated books about individual animals.Carolyn PhelanCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

That first seed, which also contained &#x2026;all the stars and planets, all the rocks and oceans, plants, and animals, and people, is still growing and changing with each new day as every star, creature, and being continues to unfold in ways not yet known. The illustrations are suitably cosmic. Black nothingness contrasts with spiraling color and multicultural creation symbols such as a snake, an apple, and a turtle.

{"asin": "1592981534", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A Handshake From Heaven is a wonderful children's book written by Carol S. Bannon a teacher, writer, mom, and grandma. The book shows children how the Eucharist allows them to hold God s hand and opens the door to heaven.  She uses the analogy of holding God's hand to emphasize that the more frequently we receive Communion, the more our relationship with Jesus deepens. She points out that kids do not try to rationalize the scientific aspects of transubstantiation they just believe the Eucharist is the Body of Christ. Because, as Carol says, many adults need to rediscover this truth, the book has even been used in adult ministries. Check out the website for some views of the book. It s definitely a great resource for explaining this precious gift to our kids. --Catholic Mommy Brain 2009 Book ReviewA Handshake From Heaven is a children's book that explains with gorgeous pictures and easy-to-read text our connection to Jesus Christ during the acceptance of the Eucharist at our Church ceremony. Most children have simple questions about God, Jesus Christ and the Eucharist. This book helps explain how we touch God every time we accept the Eucharist from our priest, pastor, or Eucharist minister. Michaelin Otis' beautifully drawn illustrations show how we can touch God every day by holding hands with someone we love or interacting with everything around us; including flowers, butterflies and puppies. However, the primary message of the book is the Eucharist and how God opens the door to Heaven every time we experience the Eucharist. A well-written book that has a fantastic fit with first and second graders who are usually approaching their First Communion and need as many materials as they can get that explain the process of the Eucharist and what it really means to attend Mass and accept the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Minimal text on each page makes this a great book for young readers to read on their own. Bannon also makes it clear that it is everyone's own choice to accept Jesus Christ and the Eucharist and the gift we are given when we experience this sacred moment. Armchair Interviews says: Highly recommended for a young audience and even adults that are going through a Christian religious conversion. --Armchair InterviewsI just wanted to let you know how beautiful your book - A Handshake for Heaven is. This book has touched many lives here at St. Mary's. I read the book and automatically feel in love with it.

In widely spaced lines of text combined with plenty of bright, well-chosen color photos, Stille's books in the Science Around Us series ably introduce topics in the physical sciences. InEnergy, she describes several ways that energy is produced, stored, and converted from potential to kinetic, and then closes with cautionary remarks about air pollution and energy conservation with a look at a \"hybrid\" automobile. In the companion volume, she vividly demonstrates differences among solids, liquids, and gases (\"You can drink a cup of milk or a can of soda pop. You could never drink a rock\"), and offers budding scientists some insight into how these states of matter behave, and why. Stille provides additional information--for instance, about plasma, another state of matter--at the end of each volume, and closes with a variety of back matter, including brief book lists and a link to a dedicated publisher's Web site. Despite some oversimplifications (\"electric\" energy is more properly called \"electromagnetic\"), these provide visually appealing support for early science curricula as well as inviting ways to get children to think about the world around them.John PetersCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Diane Manahan was known to her family and many friends as strong, energetic, irreverent, generous and loving. Here, Diane's sister-in-law and her partner share how Diane chose to live out her remaining time and how she chose to die. She had been a nurse and a teacher throughout her adult life, and when she learned that the breast cancer that had been in remission for a few years had returned and metastasized, she gave up neither of those vocations. Instead, she incorporated her experiences of treatment and pain into her teaching in order to help her students become better nurses. With her physician husband, she also explored and incorporated alternative therapies into her treatment.When it became clear that her death was imminent, she began to make detailed plans for her life celebration and for the handling of her remains. Manahan (On My Honor, 1998) and Bohan present this book not only as a testament to Diane, but also as a preservation of her legacy of good works, and to share the resources that she and her family drew on during the last months of her life.Through Diane's journal, letters, photographs and family and friends  memories of her, the authors create a vivid portrait of this extraordinary woman, and offer necessary guidance to those living with cancer and their loved ones, about how to continue living, and, if and when the time comes, dying, according to their values.A wealth of knowledge, strength and comfort. --Kirkus DiscoveriesLiving Consciously, Dying Gracefullyis a compelling and intimate story of a woman and her family's journey with cancer and beyond.

The book, authored by Diane's sister-in-law Nancy Manahan and partner Becky Bohan, includes writing and poetry by Diane and reflections and observations by a rich and diverse circle of friends and family that surrounded Diane and her holistic physician Bill Manahan over the 5 &#xBD; years that Diane lived following her diagnosis with breast cancer.While Living Consciously, Dying Gracefullyis an invaluable resource book for lay people facing a serious illness and death, it is also an important resource for health professionals.
