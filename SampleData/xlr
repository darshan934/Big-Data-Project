Baker, who collaborated in writing Montague's autobiography, was a teenager growing up in California when he listened to the Magnificent Montague on the back end of the radio dial and became fascinated by his edgy soul. Some years later, his \"whatever happened to\" interest was the impetus for contacting Montague. What Baker discovered was a human phenomenon with stories beyond imagination, a poet, producer, performer, promoter, and radio station owner--edgier than Baker remembered. Montague's radio show reflected black taste and interests and became a sounding board for the same, but it also became an outlet through which many whites and other Americans began to adopt both the music and its meaning as their own. The cultural integration of America forms a substantial subplot of this fascinating look at the life of a disc jockey.Vernon FordCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

In describing the complicated origins, conduct and outcome of the conflict, Wayne State College history professor Hickey shows how myth has helped construct a history that we can understand and accept. Three 19th-century writers in particular&mdash;British naval historian William James, American popularizer Benson Lossing and man of letters Henry Adams&mdash;promoted already familiar stories of the war. While Hickey investigates, analyzes and critiques a spectrum of legends about the war's roots, its campaigns and armed forces, and its military and political leadership, he's no mere debunker. Stories like Col. Henry Johnson's killing of Tecumseh in hand-to-hand combat survive his scrutiny. And Capt. James Lawrence did say, \"Don't give up the ship\"&mdash;though those were not his last words. But Jean Lafitte's role in the Battle of New Orleans is diminished to the advantage of his brother Pierre. And blacks played a long-neglected role on both sides. These are only a few of the revelations awaiting readers of this richly textured model of historical revisionism, which confirms Hickey's status as a leading scholar of the early national period. 10 photos.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0252029356", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A gifted musician and a brilliant technician with the baton, the Hungarian-born Reiner never became a star like some of his contemporaries, and, as Morgan documents in this absorbing biography, Reiner's prickly personality, his stubborn refusal to promote himself, his frequent clashes with orchestra managers and backers and his icy relationship with the press sabotaged his ambitions time and again. As a result, one of the finest conductors of the twentieth century is widely respected by musicians, but comparatively neglected by the public. A product of the opera houses of central Europe, Reiner enjoyed stormy yet artistically fruitful tenures with the Cincinnati Symphony, Pittsburgh Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras as well as the Metropolitan Opera. He spent a decade as the leading conducting teacher at Philadelphia's prestigious Curtis Institute, where his pupils included a young Leonard Bernstein. Morgan offers fascinating insights into Reiner as teacher and interpreter-his small but precise beat, his fanatical attention to balances and phrasing and his strong feelings about new music. (Reiner was a champion of the works of fellow Hungarian Bela Bartok.) At the same time, Morgan delves into the Reiner's darker side, noting the \"sarcasm and withering contempt\" the conductor leveled at musicians who failed to meet his standards. Union rules and changing conceptions of a conductor's role make it unlikely that we will see another martinet at the helm of a major orchestra, but this book makes it clear that Reiner is worth remembering.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0252027523", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Korr carefully explores labor-management dealings involving major league players and team owners during a crucial two-decade imbalance. The author sketches the stark imbalance that existed in that relationship until the 1960s, when Judge Robert Cannon and Marvin Miller came to represent the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). Cannon deferred to baseball moguls, as players like Robin Roberts and Jim Bunning courageously battled for such elementary rights as improved bullpens and toilet facilities and better lighting for night contests. Miller's appointment as the MLBPA's full-time executive director in 1966 proved crucial, but Korr (West Ham United: The Making of a Football Club) challenges many assumptions about the labor leader. Rather than manipulating the players, Miller frequently felt compelled to respond to their greater militancy. Notwithstanding embittered attacks by sportswriters and owners alike, Miller generally remained calm and thoughtful, even prescient at times. Korr discusses how first Curt Flood and then Ted Simmons, Andy Messersmith, and Dave McNally challenged the owners' contractual leverage, which eventually led to free agency. A lengthy strike in 1981 proved the union's toughest test but kept its winning streak intact. For general libraries.

{"asin": "0252027639", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Sullivan, a business writer and owner of a corporate education company, offers a solid if unspectacular biography of the only undefeated heavyweight champion in history. He recounts Marciano's career from his first professional fight in 1947 through his death in a plane crash in 1969, looking at the sports hero as a symbol of both the optimism and the darker cultural currents of the 1950s. Sullivan provides a detailed and complete history of Marciano's fights, as well as some rich contextual background on the characters and atmosphere of boxing during the 1950s. Marciano, the child of Italian immigrants, who grew up in working class Brockton, Mass., was presented by the press as the ideal '50s man: a wholesome, patriotic family man with an all-American rags-to-riches story and worshipped by his fans as such. He was another Great White Hope in a sport dominated by black men, and though many 1950s sportswriters strove for a colorblind approach, it was nonetheless clear that they rooted for Rocky. The cultural analysis is the strongest part of the book; Russell's portrait of the private man (sometimes ambivalent about his family and notoriously obsessed with collecting and never spending money) is well researched and complex, but hampered by his often clunky and repetitive writing style. Though Marciano never achieved the popularity of Ali or Louis, his story offers a fascinating glimpse of boxing at midcentury and boxing buffs will be glad to have this overdue biography.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Rocky Marciano: The Rock of His Times (Sport and Society)", "price": 14.77, "salesRank": {"Books": 1097524}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514QCGKJ63L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0300122225", "0807105880", "1400060095", "B004B3MH4O", "0306806037", "1599219964", "1566251087", "1590131622", "002860847X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0252072626", "B004B3MH4O", "B000EWBNPU", "039525356X"]}}

Recalling the prominence the Maxwells&#x2019; story originally attained, historian Hallwas connects it with violence in post&#x2013;Civil War society and with&#xA0;the popular-entertainment aspect&#xA0;of criminals&#xA0;such as&#xA0;the Maxwells, who inspired the cheap fiction alluded to in&#xA0;the title. A diligent researcher, Hallwas uncovers all data about the Maxwell family, who in the 1860s and 1870s were tenant farmers in western Illinois and Iowa. An inability to rise above tenancy status, Hallwas argues, plus a psychological search for identity as an independent, honorable man, motivated son Ed&#x2019;s turn toward crime. Peaceful citizens thought Ed Maxwell needed a rope more than counseling, panicked as they were by stolen horses and murdered sheriffs along the upper Mississippi Valley,&#xA0;which they blamed on Ed and his pliable younger brother, Lon.&#xA0;Describing&#xA0;the posses that eventually nabbed Ed in 1881 (Lon vanished), Hallwas ably restores their escapades to the history of western outlawry. --Gilbert Taylor", "title": "Dime Novel Desperadoes: The Notorious Maxwell Brothers", "price": 13.5, "salesRank": {"Books": 893746}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O%2B%2B0ytggL.jpg", "related": {"buy_after_viewing": ["0312137613"]}}

{"asin": "0252030036", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In this meticulously researched book, freelance writer and journalist Hatfield dusts off the archives of a murder case that captured America's attention 70 years ago and breaths new life into it. Late one night in 1935, in Wise County, Va., a precocious young teacher named Edith Maxwell returned home to her abusive father, Trigg. Shortly afterwards, a neighbor overheard what sounded like a fight and went over to the Maxwell residence to check out the situation. He found Trigg lying unconscious on the kitchen floor. The next day, Edith and her mother were indicted for Trigg's murder, setting off a media frenzy reminiscent of some of the human interest stories of today-Jean Benet Ramsey, Terry Schiavo, etc. Like those stories, the Maxwell murder case quickly became fodder for both yellow journalism and tabloid sensationalism. A native of Virgina, and a one-time resident of Wise County herself, Hatfield details the Maxwell family's experiences in the years before Trigg's death, the progress of the court case (which eventually turned on a Virginia law that prohibited women from serving on juries) and Edith's rise to celebrity. Though the book's narrative is not particularly gripping, Hatfield does succeed at showing how a simple murder case in \"'hard-core' Appalachia\" reflected the larger social issues of the time. \"Maxwell's is an American story,\" she argues, \"one in which notions of women's equality and power, of the vast freedoms and terrible responsibilities given to the mass media as well as the integrity of our legal system, were severely put to the test.\"Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Competitive and intimidating, Elkin became a professor legendary for his brilliance and venom, a dedicated husband and father, and an ambitious and &#x201C;uncompromising&#x201D; writer of mordant insight and artistic chutzpah. His audacious fiction garnered elevated critical praise and disappointing sales, then his body betrayed him with a heart attack when Elkin was only 38, and shortly thereafter with multiple sclerosis.

The emphasis here is on 20th-century accounts, though some  attention is paid to the more contentious writings and  biographical materials of the 19th century. The authors evaluate  all sources evenhandedly and sort out the various schools of  thought regarding the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, including recent approaches. Given how  controversial these topics can be, their achievement is  especially impressive. Two appendixes evaluate print sources  about Mormonism and reference sources relating to it.

{"asin": "0252030184", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "\"I think better on the typewriter than I do just talking,\" William Maxwell told Burkhardt in one of their many meetings together in the nine years preceding his death, at 91, in 2000. Seated on the patio of his summer home, the novelist and former New Yorker fiction editor (who worked with such literary giants as Nabokov, Salinger and \"the three Johns\": Cheever, O'Hara and Updike) clacked out answers to her questions on his Coronamatic while Burkhardt, an assistant professor of English at the University of Illinois, read by his side. From these mechanized Q&A; sessions, as well as from interviews with Maxwell's friends, family and colleagues, Burkhardt emerges with a comprehensive picture of the author's work as dominated by the recurring themes of childhood, psychoanalysis and maternal love. Maxwell lost his mother to the Spanish Flu at age 11, a defining experience that he claimed \"made a novelist out of him.\" Recovering the \"lost Eden\" of his early years became his work's \"central mission,\" and Burkhardt uses these autobiographical elements to analyze Maxwell's writing and correspondence. Because Maxwell dedicated himself to covering the same thematic ground in multiple books, however, and because Burkhardt's method is doggedly biographical, her interpretations can grow somewhat repetitive. After all, there are only so many ways to attach the number of young mothers who die in Maxwell's fiction to the one he lost in real life. Burkhardt's account of Maxwell's 40-year tenure at The New Yorker also falls somewhat short. She offers a few intriguing tidbits, like how Harold Ross and other editors used knitting needles to pinpoint unsatisfactory details in covers and cartoons, but fans looking for further insight into the magazine's history may be disappointed. Nevertheless, though the New Yorker anecdotes are few and far between, Burkhardt's exhaustive study of the author's life will be required reading for any devoted Maxwell enthusiast. 8 pages of b&w; photos.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Biggers informs us that they are the last remnants of a pre-Columbian Mexico, spread out over miles of barrancas and forests. He describes the people and the villages; one was no more than a 250-year-old mission, a boarding school, a clinic, and a cooperative shop \"plopped into the basin of a creek-forged valley of steep rock faces.\" Biggers visits their corn beer celebrations, Sunday gatherings at the mission plaza to attend mass and the judicial assembly that follows, caves in which some Raramuri still live, and their wood-chopping expeditions.

{"asin": "0252031814", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This meticulous study of Lincoln leaves aside his well-covered presidency to spotlight his rather pedestrian career as an Illinois lawyer. Lincoln spent roughly 25 years practicing law, and most studies of this period cast it in terms of his later accomplishments: \"admirers have done what they can to inject a little excitement into his legal life.\" Using the recently completed Lincoln Legal Papers Project, fourteen years of \"unearthing every available primary source on Lincoln's law practice,\" history professor and author Dirck (Lincoln and Davis) applies the corrections, unearthing a more mundane, and more human, Lincoln. The vast majority of his nearly 4,000 cases were run-of-the-mill debt litigation, fairly standard for the growing credit economy. And although he had a few high-profile cases (murders, railroad lawsuits), Dirck's technique is to show more about Lincoln through everyday details-the masculine squalor of his Springfield office, the rough-and-tumble camaraderie of the circuit courts, and the quiet exactitude of his paperwork-than more sensational (and largely apocryphal) stories. Historians, legal scholars and practicing lawyers will find a sophisticated, thoughtful treatment of Lincoln and 19th century law practice, but Dirck's command of legal theory and straightforward prose make this book appropriate even for those without prior knowledge of the law or Lincoln's life.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Haddix has done prodigious research, drawing on the copious jazz literature as well as previously published conversations with Parker&#x2019;s former associates and friends, but seems to have initiated rather little interviewing himself in trying to accomplish his ambitious goal.

{"asin": "0252060415", "description": "These four collections mark the tenth anniversary of the Illinois Short Fiction series. As might be expected, all are good. Gerber's collection is possibly the best, depicting the family lives and personal thoughts of ordinary souls with such a light touch that each story is a personal encounter. Recurring characters tie some of the stories together, as do similar themes on aging and three-generational family relationships. Givner's Tentacles of Unreason is the least successful of the collections. Many of the stories have academic settings and suffer from the overworked quality of workshop writing. Others merely ramble with no plot at all and just a few flashes of humor or insight. However, when her stories do work, as in ``The Lost Sheep,'' they contain a firm kernel of truth and humor. Norris's stories are filled with isolated people struggling to make contact. These are sad stories, often about grandparents who feel forgotten, but they are nevertheless filled with hope for new beginnings. Norris has a distinctive style that is apparent throughout the collection. In Getting To Know the Weather , Painter develops an acute sense of foreboding, as her characters try to deal with the unexpected. ``Sylvia'' is wonderful: Sylvia is a black housekeeper who comes from a very rough black neighborhood to work in Lynne's lovely upper-middle-class home; Lynne appreciates her, but Sylvia's dark background begins to haunt her employers' comfortable life. Painter's stories are dramatically original and uniformly impressive. Ann H.

There's much to be said for the label's legacy: in addition to introducing James Brown to listeners, King had stars in several popular genres, pioneered the introduction of R&amp;B songs to the country music repertoire before Sam Phillips at Sun and may even have released the first rock and roll record (Wynonie Harris's Good Rockin' Tonight) in 1948. Unfortunately, though loaded with great stories, Fox has some difficulty getting into gear. Instead of telling a straight chronological account, he organizes the King story around personalities, beginning with the company's founder, Syd Nathan; each subject's history is then tracked forward past their King years, forcing Fox to continually circle back and pick things up again. Some repetition creeps in&mdash;a story about how much Nathan hated Brown's first single is told on three separate occasions. Still, his account gives us a much needed glimpse of an underappreciated pop culture institution. 23 photos.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Selections from her highly praised Studies for an Actress and Other Poems ( LJ 2/1/73) include \"The Grand Canyon,\" which some critics consider her finest poem, and range thematically from the autobiographical to a concern with pollution and the environment.

{"asin": "0252062817", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Along with an excellent denominational history of the Assemblies of God, Blumhofer (Wheaton Coll.) offers a thoughtful look at the growth of Pentecostalism in the 20th century. She sees four stages of development: 1) \"restorationism\" in the early years; 2) affinity with fundamentalism, which broadened its base in the 1920s; 3) the Charismatic renewal, which crossed all denominational boundaries after World War II; and 4) the growing incorporation of popular culture since the 1970s. Each chapter presents a period from the 1880s to the present. Unlike many studies, this work predicts the beginnings of a decline in Pentecostal growth, which is attributed to the loss of a prophetic message in favor of affinity with popular culture. This is a well-researched, readable work with some new thoughts on the subject. Recommended for informed lay readers.- C.

Covering the convoluted history of the recording industry from the 1940s to the 1960s, he combines in-depth archival research with fascinating anecdotes about chart-toppers, shady characters and label owners (the ultimate risk takers). To survey the situations that turned Tin Pan Alley topsy-turvy and spawned the post-WWII rise of the low-budget indie labels, Broven begins with the symbiotic relationship of jukebox distributors, DJs and record retailers. He conducted 100 interviews, including with key industry figures: Marshall Chess (Chess Records), Sam Phillips (Sun), Jerry Wexler (Atlantic) and George Avakian (Columbia). Yet he does not ignore lesser-known players such as Mimi Trepel, the unseen heroine of rock n roll, who witnessed the social upheavals in music as she went from Brooklyn radio to head of foreign distribution for London Records. The impact of conniving entrepreneurs on the musicians and the layering of rich details and digressive detours as Broven traces the transition from R&amp;B to rock make this equal to Roger D.

{"asin": "0252062205", "description": "Photographer Carroll writes: ``I want everyone to know what an amazing, richly talented group of artists live and work'' in Chicago. This volume (and accompanying exhibit) is comprised of Carroll's portraits of Chicago artists, each ``referring directly to or re-creating some aspect of the imagery'' in the sitter's work. Alongside each portrait is an example of that work, and although the parallels between photo and painting (or sculpture) are unmistakable, the portraits for the most part are painfully contrived. In a painting by Dan Gustin, a naked man peers curiously into a Pandora-like box; in Carroll's portrait, Gustin lies shirtless on his back on the floor, looking uncomfortable and embarrassed. Cluttered with objects that overshadow the artists themselves, the portraits appropriate imagery without imbuing it withstet new meaning. The portraits that work best concentrate on a single motif; most noteworthy among these is Carroll's photo of David Klamen. Subtly erotic, the photo effectively portrays the painter as a primordial half-beast, half-man. Other artists featured include Don Baum, Linda Kramer, Jim Nutt, Barbara Rossi and Claire Zeisler.

{"asin": "0252061519", "description": "This discussion of the First Amendment is based on the Falwell v. Flynt libel suit, recounted in colorful detail. Smolla, a William and Mary College law professor, helped write a \"friend of the court\" brief to the U.S. Supreme Court, which early this year overturned a $200,000 damage award to the evangelist for \"intended\" infliction of emotional distress he claimed to have suffered as a result of Hustler magazine's portrayal of him engaged in drunken sex with his mother in an outhouse. Making legal complexities accessible to the lay reader, the author demonstrates how the case reflects current cultural and moral attitudes grounded in collective community judgments between opposing ideals of a pluralistic society, in which some view the Constitution as a moral charter and others believe in public access to all ideas or fields of human interest, sometimes at the expense of the privacy of public figures. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court, stresses the author, in effect extended freedom of speech beyond verifiable fact to expressions of opinion even of an offensive nature.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Jerry Falwell v.

In this volume, surviving Issei who settled in the rural Hood River Valley in Oregon tell their stories in interviews conducted by Tamura, an academic and a Sansei (third-generation) native of Hood River. In their own words, the immigrants explain how and why they came to America, their dreams, and their often harsh new life, mostly as farmers and orchardists. Eleven of the 14 elderly interviewees are women, whose unexpectedly positive attitude toward life in the World War II relocation camps gives the book a unique twist.

For some tastes, the book will seem too long, and its type overly small and tight, but Coles and Oresick, who have collaborated previously on Working Classics: Poems on Industrial Life, have clearly chosen to include as much as possible in order to illuminate a theme: not just work but \"nonindustrial\" work, that of a short-order cook, a woman giving birth, a baseball coach, even a scholar in pursuit of tenure. The poems themselves comprise a sort of corps, linked by mostly humble callings and their habits. Edward Hirsch describes the \"vague feeling of panic\" overtaking a subway commuter; Dana Gioia elegantly evokes the Andersonian epiphany of an overworked office employee. Excerpts from Louis Simpson's series, \"The Associate,\" wryly recount life at a book publishing company. But of course, it's the language, and not the job, that recommends the poetry.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "For a Living: THE POETRY OF WORK", "price": 4.51, "salesRank": {"Books": 1591006}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5141SQ3ARAL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0679723692", "1565843428", "0140481346", "0394478843", "0199536198", "0252061330", "0312626681", "0140280464", "0312463197", "0805834222", "1907056882", "0253337887", "0801482682", "0205681093", "0393024814", "0618068546", "1885211066", "1566892996", "0140186875", "1558611533", "0892552069", "0815604297"]}}

This book grew out of Dublin's desire to provide his undergraduates (he teaches history at SUNY-Binghamton) with a reader showing how immigrants saw and understood their own experiences. Dublin draws from a wide range of already published classic immigrant recollections, ranging from \"The Diary of John Harrower\" to \"The Nguyen Family: From Vietnam to Chicago.\" There is a balance between accounts by men and women; two of the ten chapters are written by the children of immigrants.

For the general public, Condit says, abortion falls within the realm of personal choice, but is generally regarded as morally objectionable.

{"asin": "0252064364", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "To put some of the adventure back in everyday science, this study is the place to start. Bauer, chemistry professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, upends current contentions about science literacy in a small, dense book that could be the nucleus of a restructuring of how science works in our culture, or, in the author's terms, how its reputation works. The call for more science literacy is a shibboleth in this STS-based (science, technology, society) exposition, which is a sort of deconstruction of the general image of science. Excising popular fallacies, Bauer argues that science is particular knowledge embedded in its time's social context and, therefore, in continuous change. His critique is radical: demystify the science we learn as fact (\"textbook science\"), keep \"frontier science\" (research) from being overwhelmed by structural forces in technocracy, avoid \"scientism\" as a basis of social policy. Science can be made to serve us better, stresses the author, but not as a new mythology.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method (Illini Books)", "price": 19.8, "salesRank": {"Books": 1208175}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ccmxrTYpL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0786463015", "0679747567", "0943742080", "1556436424", "1425154263", "0813521963", "0943742064", "0226294838", "0786430486", "0252072162", "0553061747", "0745651909", "1931044287", "022605196X", "0895263998"], "bought_together": ["0786463015"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1556436424", "1932846050", "0553061747"]}}

Mandy Oxendine is a light-skinned African American woman who has chosen to pass for white in order to attain a better life financially and socially. Pursued by a white landowner and the object of a traveling preacher's obsession, Mandy is discovered by her former lover, Lowrey, a light-skinned teacher who has chosen to live as a black man. The landowner's lust and greed soon lead to murder and an attempted lynching. While of historical interest in the study of 19th-century African American literature and of Chesnutt's later works (e.g., The Conjure Woman, 1899) the novel is underdeveloped, with characters that lack depth or passion and an ending that is too neatly resolved.

According to the author, who teaches American studies at the University of Kansas, jazz rose as a cultural triumph, acquiring \"its expressive potential and social meaning\" despite big-city class and racial divisions. Peretti, relying heavily on oral history and newspaper accounts, examines such topics as differences between blues and jazz, the influence of European classical music and white musicians on early jazz, the effects on musicians of economic shifts and profiteers, race relations and male dominance among these cultural pioneers.

The book's reception was disappointing, and it has been suggested that perhaps Kant and Thomas Reid were the only contemporary philosophers capable of fully understanding it. Book 1, the subject of Johnson's thorough analysis, is divided into four parts: Part 1 deals with Hume's proposition that ideas are derived from impressions; Part 2 discusses the empirical roots of space, time, and existence; Part 3 concerns itself with knowledge, probability, and the nature of the cause-effect relationship; and Part 4 centers on Hume's skepticism and his analysis of a number of metaphysical systems. Johnson (emeritus, philosophy, Univ. of California, Riverside) has done a superb job of laying out the nature and structure of Hume's arguments in Book 1, and his clear style should open the Treatise even to those relatively new to Hume.

Besides adding ballet and Ziegfeld-style extravaganzas, North signed the best conventional acts, such as ``Bring 'em Back Alive'' Frank Buck and the Wallenda family of high-wire performers; he also hyped the disfigured gorilla Gargantua into a super-attraction.

For all his big-hearted sincerity, however, Flint seldom proves entirely equal to the task of quarrying sustained pathos from his tireless soul-searching; his hunt for pithy epiphanies and durable solaces too often leaves him stranded in overdetermined stoicism or remorse.

{"asin": "0252064194", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The author, the daughter of a Chinese mother and a British father, whose family eventually settled in Montreal, wrote these stories and articles in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and they have held up well, both as works of literature and as snapshots of their time. The first half of the book is a group of stories first published in 1912. Mrs. Spring Fragrance is a Chinese woman transplanted to Seattle who both pleases and perplexes her Chinese husband by becoming ``Americanized.'' Many of Far's characters are caught in the bewildering expanse between Chinese and white communities. In ``Its Wavering Image,'' a white reporter courts a woman who is the child of a white woman and a Chinese man, insisting, ``You are a white woman--white. Did your kiss not promise me that?'' ``The Story of One White Woman Who Married a Chinese'' follows its protagonist through two marriages, first to an abusive white man who, though he talks about writing a book on social reform and suffrage, derides her as stupid, then to a Chinese man for whom she does embroidery. The latter part of the book contains a few uncollected short stories, but consists mostly of articles Far wrote about the Chinese community. One chronicles the fate of ``Half-Chinese Children,'' while another gives a straightforward account of the customs ``In Los Angeles' Chinatown.'' There is a dignified, formal quality to Far's writing that helps capture a moment. This collection is a fine tribute to one of the brave early mothers of multiculturalism.Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Mrs. Spring Fragrance and Other Writings (Asian American Experience)", "price": 19.95, "salesRank": {"Books": 513371}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JINc9YDZL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0813511704", "0295955252", "0142437093", "0452273870", "1931082065", "0486434680", "1931082219", "0316311626", "0252064356", "0486224279", "0140430407", "1573225312", "0679723420", "0811216713", "0486419312", "048640885X", "0914610007", "0312194064", "0679752552", "1594483299", "0679721886", "0452297753", "0393918874", "0140437665", "0618871713", "0143107070", "0822353350", "0892552905", "0805086846", "0679732187", "0486277860", "0451528425", "0465083617", "0813529530", "0802136303", "0385343841", "0822314134", "0860915425", "0822339617", "0451528727", "0553272934", "1438296630", "0295959894", "0806114290", "0142004170", "0822207125", "0140186859", "0486420493", "0262581086", "0876855095", "0295993537", "0486281965", "0300169221", "1400033438", "0142437271", "0679731806", "048642698X", "1491087250", "1555530249", "1880684306", "0393312372", "0486415910", "0553382519", "140007651X", "0316831301", "0807083593", "0393964817", "0393970132", "0307385906", "1883011752", "0316022365", "0140436510", "0252021134", "081121379X", "1573226068", "0252070941", "0743487672", "0195042387", "1888451947", "0140445471", "0140390308", "1400033411", "0486280411", "0385264763", "0520268172", "1551115123", "0743297334", "0679642536", "006083756X", "0295971096", "0140442170", "0486280616", "0140144528", "0935312080", "0199552320", "014310585X", "0486479013", "0813515424", "0814799485", "0140280634"], "bought_together": ["0813511704"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0486493172", "1554810272", "1401309534"]}}

Each entry provides a pronunciation if necessary, the type of place, dates of incorporation, proximity to a larger community (if the place in question has less than 2,500 residents), a brief history, references, and the date the community&#x2019;s&#xA0;post office was established.   Browsing through these pages, you&#x2019;ll find out that there are 9 Illinois place-names that include the word lake, 7 that include the word oak, and&#xA0;11 with mount. You&#x2019;ll also find an entry for Charles Mound, which is the highest point in Illinois, at 1,230 feet. This is not a book of state trivia, however. Because each entry includes references, it can serve as a guide for further research about the state and its place-names.

{"asin": "0252065077", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Dittmer's stirring history of the struggle for racial justice in Mississippi tells the story in all its grim, often shocking detail. He delivers a damning indictment of the Kennedy administration for its half-hearted policies and failure to enforce the Supreme Court's ban on segregation. White churches, the author shows, consistently opposed black demands for equality and offered no leadership during the crucial 1960s. After 1966, he contends, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) had little impact on the Mississippi movement, whereas the grass-roots Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party made strides in black empowerment. Along with key figures, such as Medgar Evers and James Meredith, Dittmer, a DePauw history professor, profiles dozens of unsung heroes. He also demonstrates that women played a dominant role in the black freedom campaigns of the '60s. His assessment of gains and setbacks to date (\"More than half the state's black children . . . were living below the poverty line in 1990\") will jolt readers.

However, she offers a useful overview of how menstruation has been addressed and--more often--suppressed in psychoanalytic discourse. Most interesting is her discussion of Freud and Wilhelm Fliess (particularly their faulty treatment of Emma Eckstein's dysmenorrhea) and her argument that the ultimate Freud-Fliess split led to a deemphasis of menstruation in Freud's theory, a deemphasis that influenced his dream interpretation and rejection of the seduction theory. Lupton considers the writings of some male analysts, particularly Claude Dagmar Daly, who theorized a \"menstruation complex\" that precedes and forms the \"nucleus\" of the Oedipus complex, as well as the writings of female analysts who, Lupton says, are inclined to \"undervalue\" menstruation and are unlikely to challenge phallocentric assumptions about gender.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Menstruation &amp; Psychoanalysis", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61mUGkf01QL._SL500_.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 3264890}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

Born in 1870, educated among the ambitious immigrant European population of N.Y.C., orphaned when he was 12, Dodson, a Bates College scholarship student, was--like many black intelligentsia of his generation--overeducated for the work that was available to him, but he found refuge in a series of academic posts teaching theater at such black colleges as Atlanta University (where he met W.E.B. DuBois), Lincoln, and, finally, Howard. There, his innovative production of Ibsen won the entire cast an invitation to Scandinavia. In plays (Sonata, The Poet's Caprice), a novel (Boy at the Window), and three volumes of poetry, he recorded the deprivations, exclusions, and insecurities that blacks of his generation suffered. He rejected dialect as ``plantation talk,'' as well as what he called the ``art of insult'' used by black writers like LeRoi Jones. Dodson's friendships--which transcended class, race, and political barriers--included alliances with W.H. Auden, Sir John Gielgud (who coached Dodson to do a black Hamlet), and Paul Robeson. His talent, charm, and idealism won patrons and supporters from Orson Welles--who offered to waive his fees for a black educational film--to the four-year-old who assured him that ``God made the world for you.'' But Dodson's sexual relationships were ill-fated and unhappy, and, in 1983, he died a lonely alcoholic, crippled by arthritis. Though perhaps unlucky in life, Dodson is lucky in his biographer--who values clarity, context, the revealing anecdote, and, above all, his subject's art.

That's too bad, because Wright may be the best writer, technically, writing about country music; we need vernacular music biographies and histories by such as he rather than by the press agents manqu{&#x82;}e and stilted scholars who usually write them. But then, Wright renders the set of depositions (which is what this is instead of biography) from Stanley, fellow bluegrass musicians, and other Stanley associates into a reading experience far smoother than most examples of oral history. As the subtitle suggests, the big subject here is not the man Ralph Stanley or his career (though we learn much about the latter; as for the former, Stanley is a model of the famous deep reserve of the mountaineer about matters deemed personal); it is the culture that gave rise to Stanley's particular artistry, which Wright characterizes as \"impersonal\" and \"classical, not romantic\" and which Stanley himself says is \"theold-timestyle of what they call bluegrass.\" Stanley is an instinctive archaist, Wright argues, as unique and important in his musical domain as Sinatra in his or Caruso in his.

The son of the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith III at first resisted succeeding his father as leader and prophet but, as his biographer underscores, his governance from 1860 until his death in 1914 was fiercely committed to the religious legacy of his parent. Differing in style from the elder Smith's \"sometimes disastrous impracticality,\" his son exemplified rugged individualism with a secular pragmatism that sprang from his legal education. An opponent of polygamy, as proclaimed by Brigham Young, the younger Smith established a viable bureaucracy and a style of leadership that characterizes the Mormon community today, notes the author, a military historian.

Dance styles from Western and central Africa became the basis for a vernacular dance style that made the rhythms of the music visible. In stark contrast to the erect spines and stiff legs of European dance, the spontaneous, bent-kneed, and angulated bodies stressed a life-affirming joy that remains vital today. From the public Negro dance contests of slave times, to the wildly popular minstrel shows, to the Harlem cabaret scene of the 1920s, to the stylized moves of Motown vocal groups, Malone records this history with an energy befitting her subject. She takes us to the present, where the heritage survives in the choreography of African American marching bands and the recent explosion of African American fraternity and sorority step shows.

These anecdotes, many of which relate the reactions or experiences of urban gardeners, children, senior citizens, and prisoners in a county jail, serve as persuasive evidence regarding the impacts of plants on human well-being.(Landscape Journal, Vol 16, No 1, Spring 1997 (Stanton I.

Green Nature/Human Nature is not only an excellent synthesis of both qualitative and quantitative research that documents the bond between people and plants, it is a synthesis of the life's work and thinking of of one of the most important figures in people-plant relationships.  Charles Lewis virtually founded the field of green psychology and, along with colleagues Rachel Kaplan, Roger Ulrich, Diane Relf and others has made it a legitimate for of science and design.  As a result of three decades of their work, we now have an empirical and firm theoretical basis that nature is as important to human experience as food, rest and learning...This is an accessible and readable volume that will warm the hearts and inform the minds of all gardeners.  I suggest you take a copy into the garden, read a few pages, !  look around, and join Lewis in his insightful and enjoyable tour of the significance of what you see.  (Community Greening Review, 1997 (Prof. Mark Francis)) --(Community Greening Review, 1997:Prof. Mark Francis)I think you have really captured the essence of what is most important about plants for people, and in saying how much I appreciate your contribution, I also want to thank you for having devoted so much of your life to exploring these relationships so fruitfully.(Missouri Botanical Garden (letter from Dr. Peter Raven, Director.)) --(Missouri Botanical Garden: letter from Dr. Peter Raven, Director.)What Lewis presnts in this book is an interesting and important approach to life and our interaction with plants, nature and our fellow humans.  Technology and urban life have strengthened the misconception that we are in control of nature, that nature is here to serve us.  We must consider ourselves as a part of nature, not apart from nature.

The result is informative but not very involving. That the war brides made huge sacrifices in leaving their homeland to begin new lives with men they hardly knew, that they overcame a mountain of red tape, culture shock, and a degree of anti-British prejudice, and that they felt lost between two worlds are predictable conclusions that need little quantitative substantiation.

{"asin": "0252063457", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Brundage, an assistant professor of history at Queen's University in Ontario, provides a nuanced corrective to theories that lynching was a monolithic phenomenon throughout the South. In fact, he shows, the frequency of lynchings and the events that instigated them varied from state to state as functions of local race relations and economic factors. Focusing on Virginia, which had the fewest lynchings in the South, and Georgia, which had a particularly violent history, Brundage notes that Georgia mobs, unlike Virginia mobs, would lynch for minor transgressions. In the Cotton Belt and southern Georgia, the plantation system fostered racial violence, while in coastal Georgia, with its mixed economy, white paternalism and a strong black community limited lynching. In Virginia, diversified agriculture required day labor, which lessened racial conflict while keeping black workers on a short leash. In Virginia, Brundage shows, anti-lynching efforts were sponsored by conservative government officials who condemned anarchy. In Georgia, on the other hand, the anti-lynching campaign was instigated by progressive social reformers, leading to a decline in lynching by the late 1920s.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Lynching in the New South: Georgia and Virginia, 1880-1930 (Blacks in the New World)", "price": 24.7, "salesRank": {"Books": 999748}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QfLGai3OL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["082031269X", "0813134269", "0813037654", "0252064135", "0300077505", "0691121869", "0674951913", "0520251768", "0807123668", "0195098366", "0807834785", "0060964316", "0820345032", "0807871974", "0674061853", "0807858420", "0807831786", "0415963095", "0674008197", "160819566X", "0807846368", "0822337940", "0820325287", "0375754458", "0195306708", "1566397537", "0807854956", "0231122373", "0415980224", "0819561886", "0195320352", "0820329304", "025207405X", "0691001936", "0813918170", "0300151276", "0195166507", "0813919827", "0312571453"], "bought_together": ["082031269X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0807846368", "0375754458"]}}

{"asin": "0252064143", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In this remarkably comprehensive history of Appalachian Mountain religion, McCauley argues persuasively that mountain religion is not so much a \"counter\" to mainstream Protestantism and Catholicism as an equally central American religious tradition with equally deep roots and radically different religious values--values including humility, tolerance, integrity, and consensus, which are of particular importance today. She pictures a religious tradition in which the heart guides the head, rather than the other way around, and she suggests that this is an approach from which American Protestantism in particular could learn a great deal. The book will certainly be of interest to scholars of Appalachian religion at all levels, and it should also be of interest to anyone who seeks a more complete understanding of the American religious experience. It is a welcome corrective to the tendency to equate denominational (and particularly evangelical) Protestantism with \"the American way.\" Though its detail may prove daunting to nonspecialists, readers who work through it with care will find it to be well worth the effort.Steve Schroeder--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Appalachian Mountain Religion: A History", "price": 27.58, "salesRank": {"Books": 505356}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51n3Xp0DVIL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572330406", "0385152442", "0253352371", "0252067592", "0813190908", "0345476956", "0813142466", "025207176X", "0801878799", "0306818361", "0945084439", "0813191289", "0813125235", "1582431604", "1400061865", "0879727608", "086554798X", "0813136695", "0807845345", "1572334568", "0807841587", "0802867626", "0199735689", "0870493418", "0870498851", "1572336579", "0813134374", "0870498932", "0807859648"], "bought_together": ["1572330406", "0385152442"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0807853682", "1400061865", "1572330406", "0813191289"]}}

He starts with his Amish and Mennonite ancestors, who immigrated to Ohio and Illinois from Alsace and Bavaria in the 1830s, and continues through four generations to his great-grandparents George and Clara Gundy. Each of the first seven chapters is devoted to a first-person narrative of one of the family members and is interspersed with the author's comments on his struggles and responses to the material as he is writing. The last chapter is devoted to the lives of George and Clara. More than a family history, Gundy's book conveys a sense of connection between the people and generations that create communities.

A distinguished combat veteran of WWII, he saw postwar service as head of the Navy Department's submarine branch; and, as director of the Navy's Special Projects Office, he had a leading role in developing the Polaris missile system for subs. Galantin recalls the loss of the Thresher at sea in 1963 and explains how that tragedy?and the mystery of its cause?led to a comprehensive examination of submarine design, construction and operation. Long involved in high-level planning and policy-making in the Pentagon, he gives a good account of how the Navy met the Soviet challenge at sea as well as the submarine's role in the post-Cold War era. Our nuclear subs, he argues, remain the chief deterrent to global strategic aggression. His Pentagon insider's view includes much interesting information about intra-Navy and interservice turf wars.

Rather, he has selected five battlefields he contends Americans perceive as most crucial to their national life, an explanation he oddly saves for his Conclusion. The battles themselves--Lexington and Concord, the Alamo, Gettysburg, Little Big Horn, and Pearl Harbor--receive a two-page summary each. Linenthal's concern begins once the battle is over, as successive generations neglected, venerated, restored, and quibbled up to the present over the contemporary meaning of each battle site. While each chapter provides a fascinating study of the use and abuse of American historical memory, the format occasionally becomes tedious: several chapters into the work we know the type of events that will occur regarding each monument--if not the specific activities. But people who have visited or plan to tour these sites will find the emotions each battlefield engendered over the years as interesting as the fighting itself.- Charles K.

Who has not witnessed their American converts' dancing in the streets in their orange robes, confidently baring their shaven heads, or endured their fundraising efforts in airports? Against those finger cymbal-clanging memories of the 1970s, Muster's narrative of her insider's experience of ISKCON is nothing less than mesmerizing. That the American adventure into the worship of the noble Krishna would come to grief after the death of their ISKCON's charismatic Guru Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Praphupada in a scandal of murder, greed and corruption was perhaps not surprising to those who saw more than the Hare Krishna's superficial celebration of Krishna's love. For Muster, who worked for 10 years as a public relations secretary and editor of the organization's newpaper, the ISKCON World Review, the humiliation of ISKCON meant the loss of an admirable spiritual vision. Her narrative of that scandal confronts the ways in which traditional patriarchy and philosophical rigidity regularly defeated spiritual vitality. Muster's book is an important testimony that might be instructive to those involved in the leadership of any religious movement.Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Betrayal of the Spirit: My Life behind the Headlines of the Hare Krishna Movement", "price": 14.04, "salesRank": {"Books": 957907}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yti4QcogL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0151620865", "0664241700", "0814775799"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0151620865"]}}

He offers sketches of individuals and of crises like that in a California town overrun by Border Patrol agents. In contrast to the newly conventional wisdom, Ungar argues that today's immigrants of color are not significantly different from previous arrivals, though some of his reportage is thin-no, he reports, New York schools have not quite been rejuvenated by immigrants. Ungar thoughtfully untangles why Californians are far more nativist than Texans and offers intriguing snapshots of groups such as the Poles in Chicago and the often unhappy Koreans in Los Angeles. Warning against short-term political expediency, he recommends Mexican border controls that fluctuate with economic cycles, because most immigrants don't want to stay; a revamping of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, including a better-trained Border Patrol; and a recognition that most illegal immigrants merely overstay their visas.

Kennedy's bold decision to race the Soviets to the moon in the 1960s represents the high-water mark of presidential leadership in space matters. But as this collection of essays by 11 presidential scholars demonstrates, the power of the president is more limited than space advocates seem to realize. Each essay reviews every administration's space policies since Eisenhower to reveal the complex relationships among the presidency, Congress, and the bureaucracy that produce policy. They clearly demonstrate that overreliance by space advocates on the power of the \"imperial presidency\" to set the space agenda single-handedly has hampered implementation of expanding space efforts as the power of the presidency waned in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate. The failure of Bush's Space Exploration Initiative in the early 1990s stands in contrast to Kennedy's Apollo decision, proving that presidential edicts alone are insufficient to implement space policy.

Cayleff, professor of women's studies at San Diego State, examines this unique life from three perspectives: Babe's life as she lived it; the public persona Babe created in order to cope with the attitudes and mores of the times; and, finally, Babe's lesbianism. Unable to acknowledge her sexuality, Babe was forced to manufacture a palatable lifestyle for public consumption; hence, her marriage to professional wrestler George Zaharias. In researching her subject, Cayleff relies on Didrikson's sanitized autobiography, subsequent biographies, newspaper accounts, and interviews with family and friends, including the woman with whom Babe shared an intimate relationship, fellow golfer Betty Dodd. The result is a groundbreaking portrait of an astute, gifted woman forced to cope with a society that grudgingly approved of her athleticism but wasn't willing to deal with her sexuality.Wes Lukowsky--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Babe: The Life and Legend of Babe Didrikson Zaharias (Sport and Society)", "price": 24.7, "salesRank": {"Books": 1299105}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yoeynrymL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0801476089", "0375702296", "0029269008", "1555536719", "088011729X", "0205665152", "0807021199", "0806139730", "031244575X", "0691096198", "0470655461", "0801475082", "1400051460", "B00A19Z11I", "0395957893", "1557287708"], "bought_together": ["0801476089"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0544104919", "B0030F7S6Q", "B00A19Z11I", "1575054213"]}}

This significant, comprehensive study, spurred by the past decade's sizable increase in rapes, is based on interviews and telephone surveys of hundreds of men and women. The authors explore the source of this fear of rape, its influence on the quality of women's lives, the results in relationships with men and the methods of coping with the physical trauma. Few women resist rapists, the authors maintain, but to avoid the danger of rape, they severely restrict their activities, especially at night.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Female Fear: The Social Cost of Rape", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M8YGRPBKL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 1343570}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

The author claims no attempt to rewrite the story of Lincoln's life; rather, he traces the origin of Lincoln's furious temper, cruel streak, aversion to women, hatred of slavery, and stormy relationship with his temperamental wife. Lincoln has been the subject of other psychobiographies (e.g., Charles B. Strozier's Lincoln's Quest for Union, LJ 4/15/82), and Burlingame does much to synthesize these other works. At the same time, he challenges the work of Lincoln's traditional biographer, James G. Randall. Utilizing the papers of Lincoln's law partner, William H. Herndon, and contemporary newspaper accounts, the author gives us an aggregate picture of a troubled man. Whether you agree with Burlingame or not, his analysis is an important new look at the man who shaped the course of a nation in peril.

In examining Seventh-Day Adventisms history and development from its inception as a postmillennialist movement in the 1800s to its current status as a faith tradition with a distinctive identity, Vance (psychology/sociology, Georgia Southwestern State Univ.) has crafted a remarkably readable book of religio-sociological research. Vance argues that Adventisms move from sectarianism to institutionalization has succeeded through the creation of physical structures that reinforce its unique identity while meeting temporal needs that allow for a more accommodating response to the world. This thesis is borne out by Vances examination of family structure, theology, and the development of the movement. One area of unique identification for Adventists is that of gender roles, and it is here, she finds, that Adventism has the greatest opportunity to alter the boundaries of church hierarchy not only for itself but for the Christian community as a whole.

Smith,Shenandoah  \"[Williams] had been rather quietly assembling, with rare dedication and devotion to his craft, a body of work that is astounding for its variety and finish... It is startling to notice that Williams' poetry has exhibited wisdom from the beginning... There are several poems here which made me put the book down and laugh until my wife came down the hall to see what was up. Certain others made me put it down againand look out the window a while, letting the good tears fall. It has been a while since I have been this grateful for a book of poems, so certain that it will be with me all the days of my life.\" - Henry Taylor, Poetry \"I read each new volume of his with full confidence that I am in safe hands, but also with anticipation, knowing that no matter how familiar his excellences are to me, I shall find occasions for surprise.\" -Fred Chappell, Georgia Review \"One of our very finest poets in full stride.\" - Harvard Review \"Williams is one of those rare poets who has managed to construct a spacious middleground between the artless and the arty; the title of his collected poems, Some Jazz a While, identifies our only indigenous art form where, to borrow a phrasefrom Mr. Berlin, it's entirely appropriate to go slumming on Park Avenue...Williams ... manages[s] to satisfy the yearning that many of us have for thememorable phrase we wish we'd said, the insight we might have had were ourperceptions a tad keener... [William's poems are] reflective of this poet's deepreverence for the most unlikely sources of verbal magic.\" - R.S. Gwynn, The Hudson Review \"[Williams is] more formal than William Stafford, but almost as fluently productive; more cosmopolitan than Wendell Berry,but as preoccupied with America and Americanness\" - Publishers Weekly \"I am delighted to meet Miller's literary persona en masse and to find in hisCollected Poems the orneriest cultural complexity. His is a world of shrewd and mortal observation, especially when mortality pretends too much.\" - Gordon T. Osing, Arkansas Review \"The poet Miller Williams in his latest book, Some Jazz a While, offers the many fans of his earthy and genuine style a collection of Williams' most representative works, along with some fresh flowers for picking in a 279-page garden of prose... Williams is at his best when telling rawboned tales of life at itsdeepest roots... You will not regret buying this book.\" - Mike Masterson,Northwest Arkansas Times \"This is a terrific introduction to the distinguished work of Arkansas's best-known contemporary poet... The poems are sophisticated, intelligent, wry, whimsical andmostly short, and the voice is as place-distinctive of Arkansas as, say, Robert Frost's was of New England. It's a wise voice, unloud, unbitter, increasingly avuncular.\" - Bob Lancaster, Arkansas Times \"A celebration is in order. In Some Jazz a While: Collected Poems Miller Williams has delivered a gift from the hills... That a poet can hold ourattention for four decades is not a common achievement... Williams' humor is best understood as wit, arch wordplay that teases the intelligence... Its faithful readers take delight in the thought imbedded in the music of the language rather than the concocted image... Some Jazz a While will compel a full-scale critical appreciation. More importantly, this collection is a rich feast for those who know Williams well and for those who have never had the pleasure.\" - Ben Johnson, Arkansas Democrat Gazette \"Miller Williams is both a surprise and a delight. He's witty and sly and his words slide right into your life as refreshingly and deliciously as rain on the hottest day of the year...

Happy as a pig among truffles, I hurry to the next treasure.\" - William Stafford \"There is no other voice like Miller Williams's. I'd know one of his poems in a dark room, dark alley, dark church where no names are given.\"- Betty Adcock \"[Williams looks] at what everyone has looked at, seeing what no one has seen.\"-Howard Nemerov \"His poems reveal the basic spirit and needs of humanity that are always pulsing behind the facade of civilization.\"- Richard Hugo \"Miller Williams writes about ordinary people in the extraordinary moments of their lives. Even more remarkable is how, doing this, he plays perilously close to plain talk without ever falling into it; how close he comes to naked sentiment without yielding to it; how close he moves to being very sure without ever losing the grace of uncertainty. Add to this something altogether apart, that what a good reader can expect to sense, coming to these poems, is a terrible honesty, and we have among us a voice that makes a difference.\"- John Ciardi", "title": "Some Jazz a While: COLLECTED POEMS", "price": 23.07, "salesRank": {"Books": 1423486}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712H4JA174L.gif", "related": {"also_bought": ["0252023625", "0807115746", "0807113301", "0807133531", "0807131326"], "bought_together": ["0252023625", "0807115746"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0252023625", "0807115746", "0807131326"]}}

{"asin": "0252068114", "description": "Suffragist, lesbian feminist and pioneer advocate of women's career and educational rights, Martha Carey Thomas (1857-1935) was president of Bryn Mawr College and one of the founders of Johns Hopkins Medical School. According to this wholly engrossing and often shocking biography, she was also a plagiarist, an elitist snob, a racist who actively discriminated against Jewish and African American applicants to Bryn Mawr and a deceitful, autocratic administrator. Horowitz ( Campus Life ), a Smith history professor, presents compelling evidence that Thomas's lover, Mamie Gwinn, ghostwrote all or part of Thomas's Ph.D. dissertation, and further, that Gwinn was the unacknowledged collaborator of Thomas's Bryn Mawr lectures. With sympathetic insight, Horowitz probes how Thomas replaced the Christian faith of her orthodox Quaker parents with a positivist belief in evolutionary science. Horowitz also unravels Thomas's partly simultaneous, passionate affairs with bohemian Gwinn and wealthy Mary Garrett, a balancing act complicated by Gwinn's love for novelist Alfred Hodder. This is a brilliant portrait of a complex, divided personality. Photos.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "The Power and Passion of M.

{"asin": "0252067096", "description": "When one thinks of locales famous for the blues, Chicago, the Mississippi Delta, and maybe Texas come to mind. Cincinnati, while not possessing the distinctive sounds that make the aforementioned locations so immediately identifiable with a particular style, nonetheless has a history of individual performers and record labels that makes it a notable city for blues scholars. The river and the railroad brought many rural African American musicians to the city as far back as the early 1920s. Mass popularity did not arrive until the late 1940s and early 1950s, when Roy Brown and Wynonie Harris recorded their own brand of music for King Records--a sound that became known as rhythm and blues. King would later usher in soul music with the likes of Hank Ballard and Little Willie John.
